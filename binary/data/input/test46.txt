Good afternoon, I was told to use this channel to find out about the maximum benefits a family can get, could you please help me out with that.
Do you have any children who could qualify.
Yeah, in fact i have.
Very good, Well then, you must know that in this case, there's a limit for what we can pay to each family, Your total would depend on the benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on your record.
Um, i see, those factors are reasonable, Look, another doubt i have is if my spouse can get any benefit or at least medicare, even she didn't worked under social security, is it possible.
Don't worry, if fact she can, Even if she never worked under SS, she can get benefits if is at least 62 of age and you are already receiving your retirement or disability benefits, In regard of medicare, she can qualify at age 65.
So, she can really qualify for those and really have them then.
Yeah, As said before, she can enjoy a benefit is she's 62 and you're already receiving a retirement or disability benefit, plus be able to qualify for medicare at 65.
Thanks, i just wanted to be sure, Oh, and how much will my spouse receive, given my benefit is higher, please.
If you have a higher benefit, your spouse will get an extra amount on your record, In that way, the combination of benefits equals that higher amount.
I see, i see, interesting thing, A last question, please, What happens if my spouse begin to receive benefits, There will be some effect.
Well, the immediate effect would be that the benefit amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to her full retirement age, That applies if she begins to receive benefits between age 62 and her full retirement age.
