I'm thinking about opening a driving school and need information about the requirements to do so.
The first thing you need to do before submitting an application is to receive approval from DMV for the use of the name for your driving school.
Do you plan to teach the Pre-licensing course.
Yes, I will be.
In that case, you will need to have a classroom that meets DMV's requirements, This means you'll need to have an experienced instructor who holds a valid instructor's card and has 1,000 hours or more of experience being a behind the wheel instructor.
What's next to prepare for.
Once you have submitted an application, an inspection of your business location will take place, You will need to show the inspector the original lease and the original business certificate.
What happens after I get approved.
Has your business location been inspected.
Not yet.
Does inspection requirements change if I offer the Pre-licensing course.
Yes, the classroom will need to be inspected, You can view the classroom requirements on the Request to Premise Check form.
What if I have additional guestions about the requirements and documentation needed.
For more information, you can call Driver Training Programs at 1-518-473-7174.
