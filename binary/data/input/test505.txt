I need some information about exchanging my driver ID card, Can you please answer some questions I have.
Of course, Are you turning 21 soon.
No, you flatter me, I'm not that young anymore.
Are you currently expecting your new ID.
No, I know it will arrive sooner or later, I'm in no rush.
Would you like to know where we mail your ID.
No, I already know it will be sent to my address on record.
Would you like the document to be mailed to an alternate address.
Yes, that'd be great, Due to my job I'm abroad a lot.
Are you planning to apply either by mail or at an office.
Yes, by mail.
In that case you can ask that your replacement document be sent to an address that is different from the address on your document, You can't have it sent to a different address when you order online.
What if I want my non-driver ID to be sent to that address too.
You'll have to include an additional note and clearly print the alternate address, Don't write the alternate address on form MV-44, The mailing address you write on form MV-44 must be the address that is listed on your photo document and your DMV record.
