I just received a Notice of Registration Suspension and need to know if I have to attend the hearing.
Have you read the Notice of Registration Suspension.
Yes, I received it yesterday.
You can request an in-person DMV hearing or request a hearing by affidavit, which is a hearing on paper, This is up to you, Your Notice of Registration provides instructions about how to submit the affidavit to DMV.
So, if I submit the affidavit, I don't have to attend the hearing.
Yes, that is correct.
What if I don't request a hearing or send an affidavit.
The DMV will then suspend your registration immediately.
How can I dispute these allegations that I failed to pay toll fees.
You will need to contact the tolling authority that is listed on your Notice of Registration Suspension.
Does the tolling authority issue toll violations.
Yes, the tolling authority is responsible for toll violations, The tolling authority includes the New York State Thruway Authority , the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority MTA Bridges and Tunnels and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Can I call the tolling authority.
