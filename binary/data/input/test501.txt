Hi there, I'm searching information related to a non-driver id card.
Sure thing, I have to ask, Are you turning over 21 anytime soon.
No, not at all.
Do you have active the service to receive a new one by mail.
Yes, I think I have.
The you should get a new one in a 2 weeks period.
And what do I do if I don't get it in those 2 weeks.
If that happens, then you can contact us.
And what can you tell me about a real ID.
You can get a enhanced or real id to replace your online document.
If is possible to do this even if I'm overseas.
Yes, you can do this process through the mail.
And what I need to do for it.
You will need to summit a complete application for permit for a driver license or non-driver id card MV-44, along with a proof of identity and the appropriate fee.
