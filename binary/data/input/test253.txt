I've been having doubts about the veterans care system, I know you have some facilities for veterans but, Are there any other places in case i need care.
Sure, we have some, You can look for a Veterans outpatient clinic or a mobile Veterans center, to get some care.
Are you located far from your nearest Veterans medical center.
No, i'm not that far.
While you are on that, could you tell how much facilities do you have.
On that regard, we count with at least 1,200 care facilities on all over the country.
Um, yeah, that sound like many places to choose from, Anyway, Do i need some requirement to use these services.
Yes, You'll have to sign up with Veterans health care and have receive care from us within the past 24 months.
I see, Hey, i probably will have to move outside U,S, so in that case, Is there something i need to do.
Indeed, you have to sign up to the Foreign Medical Program, where you'll receive from us, the payment of your treatment for a service-related injury or illness.
O,k that's pretty fantastic, really, What about changing something basic like an address,.
