Hi there, I want to fond out how much my spouse will receive in benefits upon retirement.
Does your spouse qualify for benefits on their own Social Security record.
Yes, they do.
In this instance, we pay their own benefits first.
What happens if my spouse qualifies for benefits from their own record and also from my record.
null.
How much in total can a family receive in benefits.
The total amount varies but generally, the total amount that you and your family can receive is about 150 to 180 percent of your full retirement benefit.
How much will my spouse receive if they begin receiving benefits at different life stages.
If your spouse receives benefits between the age of 62 and normal full retirement age, the amount receivable  will be permanently reduced by a percentage, based on the number of months up until their full retirement age.
What criteria are in place which will allow my spouse to receive benefits upon retirement.
Your spouse may be able to receive benefits if they are at least 62 years of age and if you are receiving, or are eligible for retirement or disability benefits, even if they have never worked under Social Security, Your spouse can also qualify for Medicare at the age of 65.
