I have to do this within a month of becoming a NY resident.
Yes, that is correct.
Can you suggest a topic to me.

That's a great topic, But I have another question, What should I do if I can't get a letter or abstract showing the date of issue.

A judge considers these facts to decide if your intent is to make NYS a "fixed and permanent" residence, According to this law, students from other states or from other nations who attend school in New York State are usually not considered residents of NYS.
Do I need to visit the DMV office to make an exchange.
