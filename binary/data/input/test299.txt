I require some information about ionizing radiation exposure.
Of course, Here you can find out if you can get disability compensation or benefits for illnesses including some cancers believed to be caused by contact with radiation during military service.
That's what I was getting at, Am I able to get disability benefits from VA for this.
Do you have an illness that's on our list of illnesses believed to be caused by radiation or that doctors say may be caused by radiation.
No, I don't.
Unfortunately, that means you aren't able to get disability benefits.
Hold your horses, how do I get these benefits then.
To receive benefits, you'll need to file a claim for disability compensation and provide several evidence supporting documents.
I know, I've read about the records you need from me, But if I submit those, if I file my claim, what will happen next.
Then we'll ask the military branch that you served with or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to give us a range of how much radiation they think you may have come into contact with, We'll use the highest level of the range they report to decide on your benefits.
What other scenarios could lead to a disability compensation.
Every illness that can be evidently linked with radiation during military service could lead to a disability compensation.
