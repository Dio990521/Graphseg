Hey, how you doing,, Look, i want to know something about the possibility of having a continuing eligibility for disability.
No problem, In most cases, you can continue to receive benefits as long as you are disabled.
And what if i go back to work.
Are you saying this because you want to keep your benefits.
Yeah, i would like that, Can I.
Well, I would tell you that you could rather prefer go back to work before tr to live on benefits.
Oh, i see, well i'll think about it, What could cause that benefits stop in any case.
Well, that can be caused for two thing, really: working at a level that we consider substantial and having some earnings considered substantial, too.
Sorry, but working at what level.
Substantial, It means that we consider important.
Oh, i understand, And another thing i think is if there are changes in my condition, isn't.
Of course, and you should responsible enough to report those changes or improvements in your condition, or if you return to work.
