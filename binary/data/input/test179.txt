I'm currently living outside the U,S, and want to know how I can apply for my retirement benefits.
In that case, you should contact the Federal Benefits Unit for your country of residence if you live outside the U,S, or a U,S, territory and wish to apply for retirement benefits.
Do you want to know what an account is.
Yeah, sure, Why not.
Online Services.
That doesn't make sense, Well, how are you going to respond to my application.
You'll receive a letter in the mail with our decision.
Have you included information about other family members when you applied.
No, I haven't finished my application yet, I'm still filling it out.
I got an error during the online application, It tells me not to enter 'special characters', what now.
Just go back and enter the information without periods or other characters.
