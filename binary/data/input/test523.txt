Hello, good day, I work with the transport of hazmat but my endorsement is about to expire.
We are here to help you the best we can, Are you interested into renew your hazardous material endorsement.
Not right now, But I worry it could expire and I don't know what I'll have to do.
Do you know how often you need to get a background check.
I'm not really sure about it.
Do you know how to provide your fingerprints for this background check.
Yes, I have the idea, But any extra explanation from you would be useful.
No problem, The service for the required fingerprinting is being provided by identigo, and all hazmat endorsement applicants must go to the identogo id centers located in the new york state.
While the background checks is complete can I get a temporary endorsement meanwhile.
Sorry, but no, It's not possible, not until we be sure of the process of the background check be complete.
This renew process can be done through the dmv.
Is not possible, sorry.
