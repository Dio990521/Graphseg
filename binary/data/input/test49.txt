I'm looking to see if you can tell me what my husband's retirement benefits will look like.
Does your husband qualify for benefits on his own record.
no, I don't think so.
Is the benefit on your record higher than his.
yes, it is.
If the benefit on your record is higher then he will get an additional amount on your record so that the combination of benefits equals that higher amount .
does when he starts getting benefits matter as to what he will get, like if he is not at full retirement age.
If he begins receiving benefits between age 62 and his full retirement age ,the amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to his full retirement age ,If your husband is under full retirement age I can give you more info.
OK, but another thing, if my benefits are higher he gets a percentage or what.
He will get an additional amount on your record so that the combination of benefits equals that higher amount .
can my benefits be less because of that or something else so that we're better off doing things differently.
Benefits paid to your husband will not decrease your retirement benefit ,,The value of the benefits he may receive, added to your own , may help you decide if taking your benefits sooner may be more advantageous .
