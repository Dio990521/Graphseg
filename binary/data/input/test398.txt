I'm looking for information on taxes and fees.
Are you looking to register a vehicle for the first time.
No, this isn't my first vehcile.
I bought this used.
Ok, will you be having a boat or trailer with it, They have additioinal fees.
Maybe, I hjave a boat trailer on another vehicle, already, though.
You can use the online calculator on our website to determine this then, though know it does not include sales tax.
Does it include all other fees/taxes besides sales.
Yes, it does, for a single registration.
What about making sure I can trail my boat on this vehicle as well as the original.
It would be the same price, or if the trailer is already registered, no cost as the trailer is already registered.
What about the difference between personal and commercial vehicles.
There are separate tables and calculators for each.
Is the plate fee different than the registration fee.
Yes, please look at the appropraite table/calculator to see the individual costs and add them up together.
