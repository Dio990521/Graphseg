I'm looking at a refund for a surrendered plate.
You would have to reference the documents I can give you.
Can I get a transfer credit.
Only for a new original registration.
I can't use it for a renewal.
No.
What if my father died and he was the one who had the car registered.
You would need a certificate of death, the registration itself as well as showing the car passed into your possession, as well as pay off anything in arrears.
Can I email those documents to you.
No, you would need to fill out the Next of Kin form and either fax it in or bring it into an office.
Can I get a refund for my 1st year's registration based off these circumstances.
You would have to fill out the appropraite forms and be eligibile as said by those forms.
What if I did not use the registration sticker.
If you bring that into a branch, along with your reciept,, yes.
