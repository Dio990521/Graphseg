I want to withdraw a board hearing.
Will you be rescheduling your hearing.
yes eventually but have to cancel it first.
You will need to send a written request to the Board of Veteransâ€™ Appeals providing good cause to reschedule your hearing at least 2 weeks before your hearing, Include your name, the VA file number for your appeal, and the reason why you need a new hearing date.
Is your scheduled hearing less than 2 weeks away.
no it is set for about a month from now.
what if I just want to cancel without rescheduling so I can come back later when I get my things together.
Did you change your mind about having a hearing.
no, but I was advised to wait.
If I just reschedule where do I send the request.
Send your written request to the Board.
