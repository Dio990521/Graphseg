How soon can I take the driving road test after I get my learners permit.
Are you under age 18.
I'm 17.
You have to wait at least 6 months from the date you received your learner permit to schedule your road test.
are the moped rules the same as motorcycle learner permit rules when it comes to a supervising driver.
If you operate a moped with any valid class of learner permit, the same passenger rules apply.
so the supervisor has to be on the moped with me.
They can ride on the moped with you or remain within one-quarter mile of you and keep you in sight at all times.
so the moped and motorcycle rules are the same for who needs to be with me.
The only passenger who can ride with you on the motorcycle is your supervising driver, If you operate a moped with any valid class of learner permit, the same passenger rules apply.
and the supervising passenger guides me on whatever comes up.
The supervising driver should exercise “general supervision” of you while you drive.
