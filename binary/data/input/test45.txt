I am confused about family benefits.
Do any of your children qualify for benefits.
Not all of them.
How do spousal benefits work.
Does your spouse qualify for benefits based on their own record.
No, they don't qualify.
If they did qualify and your benefit record is higher, then they get their benefit plus the difference.
No, pretty sure they don't qualify.
Is she eligible even though she didn't work.
She may be eligible if she is at least 62 years old.
