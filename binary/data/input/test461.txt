I have a few questions about certification requirements for obtaining a CDL.
Do you have a CDL permit issued by a NY State DMV.
Yes, I do.
In your case, you will need to certify the type of driving you do anytime you perform a license transaction except for an address change or getting a duplicate license, You will also be required to choose one driving type from the four federal driving types.
Okay, What if my driving type will be NA.
You will need to send in a photocopy of your USDOT Medical Examiner's Certificate to the Medical Certification Unit, This must be done before the expiration date on your USDOT Medical Examiner's Certificate.
Can I get a HAZMAT endorsement for my selected driving type.
Yes, you can have a HAZMAT endorsement with driving types NI and NA.
What happens if I don't keep my information updated with the DMV.
This could result in losing your commercial driving privileges.
How do I get a USDOT Medical Examiner's Certificate.
You can obtain a USDOT Medical Examiner's Certificate by receiving a USDOT physical performed by a medical examiner, Be sure to choose a medical examiner that is listed on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's FMCSA National Registry.
How do I know if the Medical Certificate is on my record or not.
You can monitor your CLP/CDL medical certification status by subscribing to text and email notifications online at MyDMV.
