hello I need information about how to renew a hazardous materials endorsement.
Do you want to know How to renew your hazardous materials endorsement (HazMat).
Yes.
We will normally mail you a renewal notice for your approval by HazMat, which is separate from the notice to renew your CDL, Follow the instructions in HazMat's renewal approval notice to request background checks.
How often do I need to get a background check.
Do you want to keep the HazMat backup.
Yes.
of course To maintain HazMat support, drivers must provide fingerprints and pass background checks every five years.
ok thank you very much, another question How do I provide my fingerprints for the background check.
Identogo provides the required fingerprint service, All HazMat approval applicants must be fingerprinted at one of Identogo's ID centers located throughout New York State.
What if I no longer need the HazMat backup.
If you don't need a HazMat endorsement, don't take the written test and don't ask for background checks.
and can the endorsement be renewed in an office.
I am sorry to inform you that you cannot renew a HazMat endorsement at a DMV office.
