I wanted to know how to get ready for my board hearing with a judge.
Will you bring evidence to the hearing.
yes I have new evidence.
You can bring new and relevant evidence to your hearing to share with the judge, .
where do I send new evidence for the board to view.
Board of Veterans’ AppealsPO Box 27063Washington, D,C, 20038.
can I send them more evidence if I get it after the hearing.
Yes, you have 90 days after the day of your hearing to submit new evidence for the judge’s review.
what if I don't want to use the board hearing with the judge but would rather use another option to appeal, will I have to reschedule.
You will keep the same docket date and your appeal will be decided at the same time as other appeals with the same date, However, the time it takes to get a decision is different on each appeal option.
what do I do if I don't want to have any kind of hearing at all.
You can write to the Board to withdraw your hearing request, This won’t speed up your appeal unless you also switch to the Direct Review appeal option, which can only be done at certain times.
