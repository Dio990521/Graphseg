do not.
Do you want to know when the judge will make a decision on your appeal.
Yes.
Your hearing will be transcribed and added to your appeal file, You will be asked if you want a copy of the transcript for your personal records, The judge will review the hearing and other evidence in your appeal file before making a decision.
Do you know how long you can present new evidence to your case.
do not.
Do you have new evidence to present.

Good in the event that you have new evidence to present, it will take 90 days, If you don't have new evidence to present, you can waive the 90-day period that is automatically added to your appeal, Some Veterans Service Organizations will ask for time to present additional arguments in support of your case, so please contact your representative first if you are considering waiving this time period.
