I want to know about reviews on schools and aid.
Would you like to know about oversight duties in these matters.
yeah.
As part of its oversight duties, Federal Student Aid routinely conducts program reviews to confirm that a school meets the requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability, During a program review, reviewers evaluate the school’s compliance with FSA requirements, assess liabilities for errors in performance, and identify actions the school must take to improve its future administrative capabilities.
How do annual reports help.
Annual reports detail by frequency the most common findings identified in the annual compliance audits conducted by independent auditors , and identified through program reviews conducted by the Department of Education at institutions of higher education.
anything else.
that's about it.
what happens after you complete a program review.
Federal Student Aid will issue a Final Program Review Determination, which is a report that includes each finding identified in the program review report, the school's response, and the Department’s final determination.
How can we see some of the reviews.
You can visit the "Clery Act Reports" page.
