Hello i would like to get information about Program Reviews.
Do you want to know the parts of your supervisory functions.
yes.
As part of its supervisory duties, the Federal Student Aid FSA routinely conducts program reviews to confirm that a school meets the FSA's requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capacity.
How can I access all the associated documents.
To access all documents associated with Clery Act focused reviews, visit the "Clery Act Reports" page, "Clery Act Reports" page.
and what do the reviewers do.
Reviewers assess the school's compliance with FSA requirements, assess responsibilities for performance errors, and identify actions the school should take to improve its future administrative capabilities.
And what should I do after visiting the page.
Visit the "Third Party Services Program Reviews" page, "- Third Party Browse Program Manager" page, An overview of the main results of the program review and audit by fiscal year is also available.
and what do these annual reports reveal.
These annual reports detail by frequency the most common findings identified in annual compliance audits conducted by independent auditors and identified through program reviews conducted by the Department of Education at higher education institutions.
