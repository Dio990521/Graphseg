I need information about how much it'll cost me to renew my license.
Your renewal fee is either on the renewal application that we will mail you or displayed before you pay online, It depends on what type of license you have.
I have a DM class license, how much is that.
If you have a combined class license such as yours you must add an additional $8,00 to the regular fee.
Okay I want to change my license from D to DM when I renew this time, can I do that without coming down to the DMV.
Yes you can make these changes when you renew by mail but not online.
Would you like to know more.
No I think I have enough information.
Where do I mail my renewal form.
The address is:NYS Department of Motor Vehicles207 Genesee Street , Suite 6Utica , NY 13501 - 2874.
