Can you explain to me about the benefits I could get from Social Security.
Would you like to know whether Social Security can provide you, your spouse, and other eligible family with benefits.
Yes, that is what I would like to know.
Would you like to know about when you retire.
No, not about retirement.
Then you cannot be provided with any information with your family and yourself about Social Security retirement benefits.
What if you cannot process my request online.
Then we would send you specific information on how you would go about contacting us by phone or schedule an appointment.
What if I want an estimate for survivors or disability benefits and do not all ready have enough Social Security credits to qualify.
You can use one of our benefit calculators to estimate your future retirement, disability, and survivor's benefits.
Could I qualify for spouse's benefits even if I never worked under Social Security.
Yes, even if you never worked under Social Security you could qualify for benefits.
