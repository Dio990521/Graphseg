I want to know more about the Group Life Insurance that you offer.
Servicemembersâ€™ Group Life Insurance offers low-cost term coverage to eligible service members.
If I'm eligible then how do I go about getting it.
We will automatically sign you up, but first we can find out if you are eligible for  SGLI coverage.
what happens if I get it and I leave the Army as a disabled veteran.
You may be able to keep your coverage for up to 2 years after the date you left the military if you are within 2 years of your separation date and you meet the requirements.
ok , so how do I know if I am eligible because I thought I was.
Are you an active-duty member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard.
I am in the Army.
Then you meet one of the requirements and you may be eligible for SGLI.
If I was in the Ready Reserve where would I pay my insurance.
You must pay your premiums directly.
