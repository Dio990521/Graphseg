Hello there, I need some information about family benefits, please.
Do you have any child.
No i don't have any at the moment.
Say, any member of my family can apply for benefits too.
Yes, they can, In that case, we'll ask you Social Security Numbers and birth certificates.
I see, and something else, i was wondering how much could my spouse receive in benefits.
Do your spouse has qualifications in his/her record.
No, it hasn't any.
Is your benefits on your record higher than your spouse.
Yeah, my benefits are higher than my spouse.
If that so, then your spouse will get an additional amount on your record, In that way, the combination of benefits result in equalization with that higher amount.
