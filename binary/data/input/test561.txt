Hello, I would like to know what extenuating circumstances allow you to qualify for a loan.
Do you want to know the mitigating circumstances.
not all.
Do you think your situation presents a situation that otherwise qualifies for extenuating circumstances.
I don't think I have a mitigating circumstance.
Have you already had a review, although this does not guarantee approval.
if they already did the review.
you should very well provide a statement containing an explanation of the circumstances of your mitigation and the appropriate applicable documentation to support your claim.
can you give me a description of the borrower.
well the borrower has had a foreclosure in the last 5 years preceding the date of the credit report.
ok I understand and what is the required documentation.
it is the Release of the lender's deed.
