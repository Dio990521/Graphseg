Hello and good afternoon, I'll probably be on need for health care but i'm worried about the possible costs, could you tell me about how you calculate what i have to pay.
Are you referring about how we determine your possible payments based on your income.
Yes, that's precisely my doubt, can you clear it out.
O,k, lets see, Aren't you receiving VA disability compensation, or don't have some special characteristics like being a Medal of Honor recipient.
NO, i not receiving anything nor being recipient for any award or honor.
I guess you need information, personal information for that operation, aren't you.
That's right, But be aware that if you obtain qualifying status for VA health care, you won't need to give us that income information.
O,k So from which source you'll get that information to match my eligibility.
Well, we'll receive that information from the IRS ans the SSA each year to confirm you are still eligible for free VA health care, If that change, we'll contact you.
Umm pretty trusted, What about if i have a family or partner.
If you have any of those, or even a dependent child, you should inform us and include this income in your application.
