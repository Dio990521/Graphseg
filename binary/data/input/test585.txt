Hi there, I would like to know when a repayment plan can start.
The repayment plans starts with a lower payment that increase every two years and this can goes for 10 to 30 years.
Do you have a low income that you think and it will be a problem for the repayment.
NO, not really, my income is not so low, but I need to have this in consideration.
Great, thank you, But what can you tell me about the payments that I need to do every month.
Well, if you have a consolidation loan the monthly payments start out low and get increased every two years.
I see, that sounds good, But this goes with the federal loans, right.
Yes, that's for the william d ford federal direct loan program.
And all the loans programs can be consolidated.
Yes, every program can be consolidated.
There are any subsidized loans.
Yes, there are, the kind of direct one.
