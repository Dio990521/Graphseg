Hello there, I came here because I need help replacing my non-driver ID card, Can you help me out, please.
Of course, Are you turning 21 soon.
Oh, now you flatter me, No, I'm way older than that.
Would you like to know when you get your new ID.
Yes, I can't wait.
Allow 2 weeks to receive it in the mail, You can check the mailing status of your photo document online.
What if I already waited more than 2 weeks for it.
In that case you can contact us.
Could it have to do with the fact that I'm currently living abroad, What should I consider in this case.
We recommend that you send us a pre-addressed priority mail return envelope with your application, This will help ensure that we send your new ID to the correct address.
Well, I got my non-driver ID in August, 2017 and I'm not sure what kind of document it is.
You have a Standard document, Newly issued Standard documents show: 'NOT FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES'.
