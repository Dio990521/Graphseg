How can I enroll in direct deposit.
Are you already receiving benefits.
yes.
do you have a bank account.
no.
and what should i do when i decide which account is right for me.
Inform the representative of the financial institution that you are interested in registering to receive your benefits through Direct Deposit.
What if I already have an account.
in that case carry your checkbook or a copy of your bank statement.
And how do I do if I am currently not receiving benefits.
tell the Social Security representative when you apply for the benefits you want to enroll in Direct Deposit.
