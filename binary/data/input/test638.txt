Good morning, I'm trying to submit some FAFSA related information, and find out that I have to submit my parent's information too but, what if I can't do that because mayor causes.
I assume you're a dependent student.
That's correct, I have this dependent status, What can I do then.
O,k, lets do some check ups first, Are both of your parents in jail.
Oh, well, in fact, they are, It's kind of  shame for me.
Well, don't worry, That's a special circumstance, so you can submit your FAFSA form without having to submit your parent information.
OH, that really is a relief, That information is kind of mandatory for real or foster parents.
It is, Whereas you have your real parents or you being adopted, that information is required, But, as said before, there are special circumstances that avoid entirely this requirement.
I see, Well, that makes kind of sense, in matter of fact, I suppose is the same if it something like my parents living outside U,S,, is that right.
Kind of, Is that were your situation, you still should report your parent's information, but selecting the "Foreign Country" Option from the "state of Residence" section in your FAFSA form.
Umm, O,k, O,k, I see there is many options then, Look, I guess that required information touches that from taxes, I'm right.
That's correct, You need to clarify if they have filed taxes being outside U,S.
