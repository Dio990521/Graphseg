If I did not qualify for benefits on someone else's record, can I add other members of my family.
Yes, even if you do not qualify to receive benefits on someone else's record, some members of your family may qualify to receive benefits on your record.
and can I add them.
Are you interested in obtaining information about the benefits for your family.
not.
never married or had children.
Yes, i got married.
some family members may not qualify for benefits on your record for now.
ok I understand but in case the benefits paid to me as to my spouse, can the retirement benefit decrease.
no, benefits paid to you as a spouse will not decrease your spouse's retirement benefit, In fact, the value of the benefits you can receive, added to your benefits, can help your spouse decide whether taking benefits earlier may be more advantageous.
By applying, do I qualify if my spouse is already receiving benefits when I submit the application.
no problem if you and your spouse apply at the same time, we will also check your eligibility for spouse benefits, If you qualify, your application will automatically serve as a request for spousal benefits.
