Hi, good morning, I want to know about the National Call to Service program, please.
No problem, Did you performed a period of national service.
No i did not.
Anyway, who's covered.
Just veterans get covered.
And what kind of benefits they get, please.
Well, there they have choices, They can choose between a cash bonus of $5,000 or a Repayment of a qualifying student loan not more than $18,000.
That sounds nice, Where can i get more information about it.
No problem, You can refer to the National Call to Service program pamphlet PDF.
I guess there has to be some requirements or this, isn't.
Indeed, Did you completed your initial entry training and then continued to serve on active duty for 15 months in a military occupational specialty designated by the Secretary of Defense.
No, nothing like that, no.
Then, sorry, but you can get any benefits.
