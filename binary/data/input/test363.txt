I am looking to learn about co-op training.
Sure, I can help with that, A co-op program allows you to get real work experience when you are not going to school.
What are the costs associated with this.
I can help you learn that too, You may be able to get financial help.
How do I qualify.
Are you a part of the VA educational assistance program.
Yes, I do get help through that program.
Is your school part of an approved IHL.
I am not sure.
If you're not enrolled at one of the approved schools, you are not eligible for financial aid.
Well, who qualifies.
Veterans are covered.
