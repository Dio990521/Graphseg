I need to learn about VA Health Care.
I can help with that.
Should I apply.
Well, that is one option, or you can wait until after your enhanced eligibility period ends, Are you on enhanced eligibility.
I am not.
What if I have an emergency while I am on active duty.
You may be able to use VA health care.
Do I qualify.
Have you been in combat after November 11, 1998.
I have not been in combat.
Unfortunately, I may not be able to help.
