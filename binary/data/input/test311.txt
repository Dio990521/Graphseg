I want to know about enhanced eligibility for returning OEF/OIF/OND combat Veterans, please.
You can receive free VA medical care for up to 5 years after discharge for any condition related to their service in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) or Operation New Dawn (OND) in Iraq.
How can I apply at this time.
Would you like to wait to apply for VA medical care until after your enhanced eligibility period ends.
Yes, I can wait, sure.
We will not consider your OEF / OIF / OND combat veteran status in our enrollment decision, Instead, we'll base your eligibility on factors such as your income and VA disability rating.
Null.
Have you served in a combat operations theater after November 11, 1998.
That's right.
Were you discharged or released from active duty as of January 29, 2003.
No, I'm active now.
Then you don't qualify for enhanced eligibility.
