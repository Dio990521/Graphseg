Hello, I hope you're doing well, I need help with changing my address.
Do you currently get Social Security benefits for retirement, survivors, or disability.
No, I don't.
Well, what I initially meant to ask was if I can change my contact address somehow, Can I.
Of course, You can update your contact information in a safe, quick  and convenient way by logging in to your Social Security and selecting the My Profile link on the right side of the screen.
Oh, so I just need to go to the My Profile section.
Exactly, You'll find a link to update your contact information there.
Great, What if I have more questions, perhaps at a later time.
Do you refer to questions about changing your address and/or telephone number online.
Yeah, for example.
Then you can call our toll-free number at 1-800-772-1213 or visit your Social Security office.
