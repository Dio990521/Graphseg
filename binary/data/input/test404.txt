I came here to figure out how long I have to wait to take my road test, I just got my learners permit, Can you explain how long it will take.
Are you under the age of 18.
No, I'm 20 years old already.
I really, really want to drive, Is it true that I can't drive with a learners permit.
You may not drive with a learner permit on any street within a park in New York City and on any bridge or tunnel under the jurisdiction of the Tri-borough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
That's a strange regulation, but OK, I have a learner permit for a motorcycle class M, What do I need to consider.
In that case your supervising driver must exercise general supervision of you while you operate the motorcycle and remain within one-quarter mile of you.
What if I ride a moped instead.
Then the same passenger rules apply.
Let me get this straight, If I ride a moped with a learner permit, the same rules for passengers apply as do when riding a motorcycle,.
Correct, the same passenger rules apply.
