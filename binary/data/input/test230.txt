Good evening, I came here to learn more about vocational rehabilitation, perhaps you could answer a few questions I have.
Of course, Do you have a service-connected disability that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working.
No, I don't.
What if I did have one.
In that case the VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program also referred to as Chapter 31 can help, We can also help you find out if you're eligible and how to apply for vocational rehabilitation benefits and services, like help exploring employment options and any required training needs.
I see, and what could you do for my children, Are there any benefits for them.
Yes, we can find out if you're eligible for certain counseling services, training, and education benefits.
Great, While we're at it, can you also lend me a hand with the application.
Of course, We can help you find out how to apply for VR&E benefits and services as a service member or Veteran.
So what exactly can you do for veterans with disabilities.
We have VR&E programs for service members and Veterans, which offer VR&E support-and-services tracks for helping you with learning new skills , finding a new job, starting a business, getting educational counseling, or returning to your former job.
