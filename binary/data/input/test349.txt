Hi, i'm in search for information about Education courses for veterans.
Are you looking to upgrade your skills, start or advance in your technology career.
Yes.
Well, then we must know if you're in fact eligible for the program.
What kind of benefits can i get with the VET TEC.
Fo example, you can get a full-time tuition for this high-tech training program.
That's something, What kind of requirements i must meet.
Lets see, Are you out of active duty.
Yes, i'm out for some time now.
Did you qualify for a VA education assistance program under the GI Bill.
Yup, some months ago.
Do you have at least one day of unexpired GI Bill entitlement.
No, not that last one, Surely that's bad, isn't.
Yeah, sorry, But the lack of that last one denies you to get inside the program.
