I need help with what to do if I want to appeal a claim decision.
Did you receive a Board's decision that you disagree with.
yes I want to appeal.
Okay, you can appeal to the U,S, Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, You can hire an attorney to represent you, or you can represent yourself.
Do I appeal it all or do I have to state what parts I want to appeal.
You can include all or just some of the issues VA has decided , You will need to list the issue you disagree with and the VA decision date for each.
what do I do if I am asked about an exam.
If VA schedules exams for you, be sure not to miss them.
do I have to appeal withing a certain time or can I take my time and make sure I do it right.
You have 120 days from the date on your decision to file a Court Appeal.
can I appeal at the nearest office so they can help me if I have questions or do I have to do it online.
You can do it in person, just bring your completed VA Form 10182 to a regional benefit office.
