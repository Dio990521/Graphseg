Good Morning, i would like to know details about retirement.
Do you mean for your family, that is.
Correct, that's what i'm looking for.
Very Well, Have you started to receive retirement benefits already.
Yeah, i'm receiving the benefits.
Excellent, because in that case, some members of your family well may qualify to get some benefits via your record, If everything goes well, both your spouse and child can receive up to one half of your full retirement benefit amount per month.
That would be great, Now, what about if my spouse start receiving benefits at age of 62.
Well in that case, the amount received will have a reduction based on the months up to full retirement age.
And what happens if any of my family members apply for benefits with me.
Not much, We'll just ask for your SS numbers and birth certificates.
So my family can qualify for benefits and those payments won't affect my retirement benefit, is that right.
That's correct, they won't affect your benefit amount.
Thanks, just wanted to be sure, now, is there any limitation for the money received.
Well, yeah, there is a limit in the amount we pay to a family, that depends on the family group size.
