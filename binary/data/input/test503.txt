I need some guidance with replacing a non-driver ID card, Can you help me.
Of course, You can replace your non-driver ID if it was lost or destroyed, or after you update your address, You can not replace your ID if it expired you must renew or apply for a new one.
Good news, What if I have a standard ID.
Then you will not be allowed to board a domestic flight starting in October 2020 unless you have a Passport.
Ah, that's a pity, By the way, how do I change my name on the ID, I am about to marry and my family name is going to change.
Are you planning to make changes other than to your address.
No, I don't plan any changes.
Was your non-driver ID issued before October 30, 2017 and is it not Enhanced.
Yes, to both.
Then you have a Standard document, Newly issued Standard documents show : 'NOT FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES'.
Well, I was aware that I have a standard ID, How long does it take to get my new ID.
Allow 2 weeks to receive it in the mail, You can check the mailing status of your photo document online.
