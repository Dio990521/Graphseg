I want to know how you pay us the financial aid.
Have you accepted financial aid that was offered.
no.
Is this your first time working with a federal student loan.
no, I've looked into it but never finished everything.
Can you tell me more about the student aid report.
Yes, we can help you find out more about the SAR, its purpose, and what you should do with the SAR.
when will I receive it.
You can learn more on how the method you use to file your FAFSA form determines when you will get the SAR.
how long does it take for the school to get my financial aid form.
It typically takes three to five days, plus one additional business day to be made available to the schools you listed on the form.
