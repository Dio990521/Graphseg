No, sorry, but I don'y have neither of those.
Alright, then I must ask, Were you homeschooled.
Yes, I was, My parents decided that was the better for me.
That's good then, because you don't need a completion credential to show that you're qualified.
That's cool, right,, Oh ,I almost forgot, heard about something called ability to benefits, too.
You heard right, That's for people who were enrolled in college or career school prior July 1, 2012.
