Hi there, I am looking for information regarding the Affordable Care Act and my VA health coverage.
The Affordable Care Act is also known as the health care law, It was created to increase access for citizens to health care coverage, to control health care costs and also to improve health care quality and care coordination.
If I don't have health insurance, do I have any penalties to pay.
This part of the law was changed by Congress, for plans that were starting in 2019, The payment referred to as the individual shared responsibility payment no longer applies in plan year 2019, for which you will be filing taxes in April 2020.
How do I get health care coverage for 2019 if I am not signed up for VA health care or the Department of Defense health care program.
You may still be able to get health care coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Enrolment for this for 2019 is now over however, You can still enrol or change plans if you have had certain life changes or if you qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program CHIP.
Does my VA health care meet the ACA's minimum essential coverage requirement for 2018.
If you were signed up for one of the designated programs listed on the website, your health coverage meets the minimum requirement for 2018.
What are these designated health care programs.
Yes, I am.
In that case, you don't have to pay any fee when you file your 2018 taxes and to qualify, you must be enrolled on one the programs that are listed on the website.
Is there a penalty applicable if I don't have health insurance.
Until the end of 2018, the ACA required that all US taxpayers had to have health insurance that met a minimum standard, Some taxpayers are eligible for exemptions from this due to certain life events, financial status or other factors, If you had affordable health care options open to you and you chose not to avail of health insurance, then you would have to pay a fee when filing your taxes.
What happens if I didn't have health coverage in 2018 or have an exemption.
In this instance, you may still have to pay a fee to file your taxes in April 2019, To find out more, I will refer you to HealthCare,gov to find out more about exemptions.
