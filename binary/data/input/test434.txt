Hello, what can you tell me about those Empire Gold plates.
Since April 1, 2010, DMV has issued Empire Gold vehicle license plates, DMV no longer issues Empire Blue and White plates.
Ah, I saw my neighbour with one of these plates and immediately wondered what those are, Now I know, What if my car is registered in one of the classes listed on your website.
In that case you can keep the same plate number from your current plates on your new Empire Gold plates for an additional fee of $ 20,00.
I understand, And how do I place an order.
You can order Empire Gold plates by phone, online or at a DMV office, The new plates and registration documents will be sent to you separately in the mail.
I have another question, Do you know how I can avoid traffic tickets before my plates arrive.
Yes, Simply put the new registration document on your vehicle even if your new plates have not yet arrived, Put the new plates on your vehicle as soon as you receive them.
Do I have to order Empire Gold plates when I renew my registration online.
Yes, This also applies when you renew your registration by mail or at a DMV office to replace your current plates when your registration is not due for renewal.
And what should I do with my old plates.
Did you receive your new Empire Gold plates.
Yes, I have them here.
Then do not return your old plate to the DMV, Recycle your old plates based on local guidelines.
