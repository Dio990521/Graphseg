Hello there, I'm interested in knowing about some benefits for my family, please.
Are you going to start receiving social security retirement benefits.
No, not yet, but i'm interested into knowing about the matter.
For example, what would happen if any of my family members apply for benefits along me.
Well, that is perfectly possible, and in that case we'll ask for your familiar's SS numbers and their birth certificates.
If any of them qualify, what would be the amount they will receive.
Well, taking your spouse as example, after effectively qualify, your spouse would receive a monthly payment of up to one half of your full retirement benefit amount, Best of all, those payments won't affect your retirement benefit.
And what about my spouse getting qualify by her own, How that affects the amount.
Ok, If that's the case and your spouse qualify by own record, we'll pay that amount first, and then the other ones.
And another question, please, Will those spouse benefits decrease my own retirement benefits.
Not at all, I can tell you, that you could find the amount your spouse will receive very useful, because it could help you to decide if you want to take your benefits earlier.
Umm, that sounds tempting, i'll have to think about it, Wanna check something, please, You said before that if my spouse gets qualified on its own record, you would pay that amount first, isn't.
Is correct, Because is something of its own, then your spouse must receive it first.
