What exactly are program reviews when carried out by Federal Student Aid.
Do you mean what duties the FSA have in overseeing their program and the reviewing of it.
Yes, that is the question that I have.
The FSA regularly carries out program reviews which confirms whether a school meets the requirements of the FSA for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility and administrative capability, During these reviews, the school's compliance with FSA requirements is measured, The reviews also assess liabilities for errors in performance that a school may have, Also included in the review is identifying the actions that a school must take to improve its future administrative capabilities.
What is the role of the FPRD in these program reviews.
When a review is carried out, the FPRD may or may not require additional actions to be carried out by an institution.
What is a FPRD.
This is issued by the FSA, It's a report that includes all the findings that were identified in the program review report, the response from the school in question and also the final determination of the Department.
Is there a FPRD available for the year 2014.
null.
