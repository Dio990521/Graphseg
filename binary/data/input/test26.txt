Hello, I'd like to learn about your retirement program.
Are you looking for family benefits.
Not necessarily.
Would you like to learn about maximum family benefits.
Sure.
Do any of your children qualify for benefits.
I believe so.
As far as the maximum family benefits, there is an upper payout limit.
Will my child receive the full payment up front or monthly payments.
If your child qualifies, he or she will receive monthly payments.
Will my spouse receive benefits.
Yes, The amount depends on how much they qualify on their own record and how high your record is.
