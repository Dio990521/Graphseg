Hi, I want to apply for disability benefits and would like to know what document I need to have in order to complete the application.
Do you know if you are eligible for disability benefits.
Yes I am eligible.
You may have to provide documents to show your eligibility, such as a birth certificate or other proof of birth, do you have such a document.
Yes I have a birth certificate.
You may also need proof that you are a U,S, citizen or that you are a lawful alien, do you have such documentation.
As I was born in the U,S, I don't think I will need to proof that I am a U,,S, Citizen.
Yes in that case you will not need any other documentation.
I need to mail the documents to you but have a few questions about it, can I ask you about it.
Is that the only way you can get your documents to us.
Yes.
If you mail any documents to us remember to include your Social Security number so that the documents can be matched with the correct application, Please do not write anything on the original documents but write your Social Security number on a separate piece of paper and include it with the other documents.
