My HazMat endorsement is about to expire and I need help with renewing it.
Do you know how to renew your HazMat endorsement.
No.
Do you know how often that you need to complete a background check to keep your HazMat endorsement.
Yeah, I know.
Have you completed one recently.
No, but I will be getting it done soon.
What if I don't really need the HazMat endorsement anymore.
If you do not need your HazMat endorsement, you won't have to take the written test or do a background check.
If I do decide to renew my HazMat endorsement, where do I get fingerprinting done for the background check.
You will need to make an appointment by contacting Identogo to select your fingerprinting location and make an appointment.
