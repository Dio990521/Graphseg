Hey, how it is going, i heard about the VR&E programs, Could you tell me about them.
Are you a veteran or service member with a service connected disability that prevents you from work.
No, thank god, just asking.
I was just asking in favor of a friend of mine, Anyhow, If a persn wants to learn something new, can you help it to learn it.
Yes, of course, Through Long Term services, the person may be eligible for vocational training so he or she can develop new skills.
And what about of those who want just to go back to their old jobs.
There's no problem on that end, The reemployment feature can help on that, so you can go back to your job before you were deployed.
O,k until now you have answered me correctly, But i bet you don't have anything for those who are self-employed, don't you.
Sorry, but you're mistaken, We do have our Self-employment feature, so if person is a service member or veteran with a service connected disability, then we can help him/her to start its own business.
Their own business, really.
That's correct, You may dream with your own enterprise, and we'll support you on that.
