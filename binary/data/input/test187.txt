Hello there, I would like to learn more about health care for spouses, if possible.
Are you a spouse, surviving spouse, dependent child, or family caregiver of a Veteran or service member.
Yes, I'm the spouse of a Veteran, My husband has served this country.
In that case you may qualify for health care benefits, In certain cases, you may also qualify for health care benefits due to a disability related to your Veteran's service.
That's good to hear, We really could use your support, my man and I, Can you perhaps tell me this CHAMPVA program or what it is called, A friend of ours, also a Veteran, mentioned it to us.
Of course, Are you the current or surviving spouse or child of a Veteran with disabilities or a service member who died in the line of duty.
No, my husband has no disabilities, He's healthy, thank God.
I understand, Do you qualify for TRICARE then.
No, I don't qualify for TRICARE, We've already checked and unfortunately I lack some of the criteria.
Are you familiar with TRICARE then.
TRICARE provides comprehensive health coverage, including health plans, prescription medicines, dental plans, and programs for people with special needs, The Department of Defense's Defense Health Agency manages this program.
That's great to know, but like I said before I don't qualify for TRICARE, But we also read about a program for family caregivers, You know which program I'm talking about.
Of course, And yes, you may qualify for health care benefits and other caregiver support through the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.
