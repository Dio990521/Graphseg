Yes I need to obtain an in-depth record of my driving history for a new job, can you tell me how to proceed please.
Do you mean a CDL driving record abstract.
Oh, is that what it's called, Then I guess that's it.
Commercial CDL abstracts show expanded driver history information that is not available on a Standard Driving Record, The information included are the following: convictions, suspensions, revocations and other licensing actions, Medical Certification Status information and Self- Certification information.
I tried to do it online but ran into a technical glitch, is there some other way to do it.
Certainly, you can mail a Request for Certified CDL Abstract PDF MV-CDL form along with the $10 fee to the DMV to the address provided on the form, or have your employer order your CDL driving record abstract through LENS.
Is this abstract official, Like I won't need anything else to prove this information.
Yes it is a certified DMV record including a certification statement and the signature of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, as well as a security watermark.
What do I enter in a search for more information.
The topic 'DMV Records' would be useful for you.
The mail in option sounds like it would be long, If I find a way to do it online what do I need to create an account.
You will need a New York State license, permit or non - driver ID or yourNew York State license.
