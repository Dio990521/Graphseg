Hello, I'm in the process to making a disability benefits claim, I was told that probably i would have to do some kind of exam, could you tell me about that,please.
Have yo already filed you disability claim.
Indeeed, i already did that.
Excellent, The exam that you was told about is known as compensation and pension exam, or C&P for short, That's a requirement from you to Veterans Affairs.
And everybody has to pass through that exam in order to get their claims.
Not everyone, That exam is required in case your medical information isn't clear enough to us to decide about your claim.
But if i have, well you know, enough information about my condition, I won't be required to do the exam, right.
That's correct, In case, your medical profile has enough information, the exam won't be necessary on any instance, That's why your medical information must be as complete as possible.
I'm sure i won't need that, but it's good to know what it is, Could you tell me about its ultimate purpose.
Through this exam, we'll be capable to determine and rate your disability, based on your disability's severity, That will influence directly on how much you'll receive, and varying between monthly payments and enrollments on veterans health care programs.
Wow, that sound very  specific, Lets say i can't go for the exam, I know is better to not miss them, but if its something out of my control, what can you do to help me.
If there are circumstances beyond your control, like sudden illness or death of a family member, we'll gladly reschedule your exam, ou dn't have to worry there.
