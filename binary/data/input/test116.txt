Will I get less benefits while I earn money then.
Unfortunately, yes, Your earnings may reduce your benefit amount.
But working while receiving benefits is possible, I won't get into trouble for that, right.
You can work while you receive Social Security retirement or survivors benefits.
Have your earnings in the prior year been higher than when we computed your retirement benefit.
No, they have even gotten less due to the bad economic situation.
In theory, how much am I allowed to earn so I can still receive benefits.
Are you younger than full retirement age.
I am 59 right now, so the answer would be yes.
In that case, if you make more than the yearly earnings limit, your earnings may reduce your benefit amount.
