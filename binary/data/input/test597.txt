I need some information about entrance counseling, please.
Of course, Do you wish to know what Entrance Counseling is.
Yes, please explain.
Have you NOT previously received a Direct Loan or Federal Family Education Loan FFEL.
Yes, I have not received any of those.
In that case the Federal Government requires you to complete entrance counseling to ensure that you understand the responsibilities and obligations you are assuming.
What if I am doing the entrance counseling to get a loan as an undergraduate student.
Then the entrance counseling will fulfill counseling requirements for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans.
I get that, And what if I'm completing entrance counseling to borrow a loan as a graduate or professional student instead.
In that case the entrance counseling will fulfill counseling requirements for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans.
That makes sense, I've asked this before, but I need you to elaborate on it: what if I am completing the entrance counseling to get a loan as an undergraduate student.
Then the entrance counseling will fulfill counseling requirements for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans.
