Good evening, May you comment me about renewal for hazmat endorsement, please.
Do you want to renew your hazardous materials endorsement.
No, this in not about that.
Are you searching for information about your background check.
No, neither that, I have some information about that regard.
Is then your inquiry aimed to know how to give your fingerprints on the background check.
Not at all,I already told you that i have some information about that process.
Sorry, is just the standard procedure to do this series of questions, So please, bear with me, Maybe are you interested into knowing how much time will be invested on your checks.
In fact, i think i don't have information about that topic, so i guees i should say yes to that.
Good, You must know about this regard, background checks can take up to 30 days or more to be complete.
That's quite a lot of days, What happens if my endorsement expires before you're done with my checks.
In that case, you'll have to wait until all the background check process is completed before your endorsement can be restored and you re-qualified by both the TSA and the DMV.
All this process can be done by mail if i want.
No problem, You can go through the process using mail to send your application.
