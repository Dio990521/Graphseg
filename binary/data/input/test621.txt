How can I file a complaint about how my professional university manages my financial aid.
Do you think your school is not managing federal student aid funds correctly.
not.
How can I find out if my school violated its own federal policy or regulations in its administration of federal student aid programs.
if your school calculated your eligibility for federal student grants, loans or work - study incorrectly.
What other point should I keep in mind.
also if your disbursed school paid your aid or credit balance incorrectly in the wrong amount, at the wrong time, or not at all.
that doesn't apply to school.
Does your school not have a financial aid administrator but participate in federal student aid programs.
no neither.
Has your school or its representative made false or misleading statements about the school's educational programs.
not.
in this case you have no evidence to file a complaint.
