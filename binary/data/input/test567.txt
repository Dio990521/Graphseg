Hello, I would like to obtain information about Program Reviews.
Do you want to know the supervisory functions of the federal Student Aid FSA.
no thanks.
What do the program reviews do.
During a program review, the reviewers assess the school's compliance with the FSA requirements, assess responsibilities for performance errors, and identify actions the school should take to improve its future administrative capabilities.
and where are these letters of determination issued.
these determinations are issued every year from FY2014 onwards.
and what do they do after completing a program review.
After completing a program review, Federal Student Aid issues a final program review determination FPRD, which is a report that includes each finding identified in the program review report, the school's response, and the Department's final determination, .
and how do I access all the documents associated with centered.
Visit the "Clery Law Reports" page.
