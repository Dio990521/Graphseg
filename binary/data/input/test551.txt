I came here to figure out how to update my FAFSA form, I have a typo on it.
Do you want to know how you can correct mistakes.
Yes, that's why I'm here.
Once your application has been processed, you can correct your FAFSA form online or on paper.
What if I accepted an offer for financial aid.
Then the financial aid staff at your college or career school will explain exactly how and when your aid will be paid out, They'll also tell you whether you need to fill out any more paperwork or meet other requirements.
Do I have to sign a promissory note too.
Yes, you should expect to be required to sign a promissory note and go through entrance counseling.
I thought so, And what is this SAR I read about.
The SAR is a summary of the FAFSA data you submitted, You the student will get your SAR within three days to three weeks after you submit your FAFSA form.
Ah, that makes sense, Thank you for the explanation, So what if I receive a student loan for the very first time.
In that case you should expect to be required to sign a promissory note and go through entrance counseling.
