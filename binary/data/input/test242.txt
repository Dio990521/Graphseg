Hi, I receive VA payments but need dates of previous payments, Is there a way I can view my VA payment history online.
Yes you can view payment history online, Do you need help signing into your account.
Yes I am not sure what is required to access my payment history.
Do you have an eBenefits account.
Yes I do have account.
To use the eBenefits to view payment history you will need a Premium DS Logon account, Your My HealtheVet won't work on eBenefits website.
I applied for disability but would like to know when I will receive my first payment.
Have you received a decision notice that shows at least a 10% disability rating.
No I have not received a decision notice yet.
How can I find out when and if I am going to receive a decision notice.
You can call the Veterans Help Line at 800-827-1000, Office hours are Monday through Friday 8am to 9pm ET.
