Hello, thanks for being patient, there are a few you may need To prove your child 's U,S, immigration status , you must show us your child 's current U,S, immigration document , such as : I-551 Lawful Permanent Resident Card , Machine Readable Immigrant Visa ;.
Does this answer your question.
yes it does, thank you.
Ok great, Is there anything else I can help you with.
Can I use it to work, who do you contact.
If you use it to work ,  we will inform DHS.
What if my child is a J-1 or J-2 exchange visitor.
If your child is a J-1 or J-2 exchange visitor , you must see your child 's DS-2019 Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status.
What if a child does not have permission to work.
If your child does not have permission to work  Lawfully admitted noncitizens can get many benefits and services without a Social Security number.
What else do you accept.
we may accept the child 's  State - issued non - driver 's identification card ;s  Adoption decree.
