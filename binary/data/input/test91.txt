Hi, I'm trying to learn about disability benefits.
I can help, For most situations, benefits are given as long as someone is disabled.
If I start working again, will I lose benefits.
It depends on what level of work you are doing.
Do you have any documents on disability.
We have several documents.
What if a medical condition improves.
We will review your case a few months after benefits begin.
How can I get the documents on disability.
Click on the links to the left.
What if I return to work.
Would you rather work or depend on benefits.
I would rather work.
You are like most people.
