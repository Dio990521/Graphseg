Hi, I need help adding a dependent to my disability.
I can help you with that, The simplest method is to file online.
Can you help with that.
I can do that, It's important to start as soon as you can so that your compensation starts.
Can my wife collect.
Did you start collecting disability before your marriage.
No, I was hurt before my marriage, but I did not file until I returned from my honeymoon.
Okay, That may makes things more difficult.
What if they back paid to before my marriage.
That may help your case, Thanks for sharing this info, It could help.
Do you have anyone I can contact for help when I have a claim.
Yes, you should contact a VSO.
