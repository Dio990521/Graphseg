Good day, I have received a letter saying that my driver license is suspended and need some guidance with how to react to this.
Have you received an order from DMV saying your license or driving privilege is revoked.
No, I haven't.
Well, I haven't paid a fine for a ticket I got, which led to the suspension, The thing is that I got the ticket outside of NYC and I'm not sure the NYC court is responsible for this, Who do I need to contact.
In that case you must contact the local court directly, DMV's My License service can give you additional information about where to pay to a traffic ticket.
I understand, Say, is there a way to find out if my license is revoked.
Of course, Simply sign up for MyDMV and use the My License, Permit or ID service, A driving privilege is your legal authority to drive in a state other than the state that issued your driver license.
Alright, And what if I was suspended for an insurance lapse.
In that case you can submit proof of insurance online.
Do you have more information, perhaps.
For more information, see the section for alcohol or drug related violations on our website.
Got that, Just out of curiosity, how could I remove a suspension for the failure of paying child support.
To do that you must contact the local child support enforcement agency or the NY State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance OTDA, The OTDA website has a list of local child support enforcement agencies.
