I am thinking about applying for Social Security Disability, but I need to know when I should apply.
You should apply as soon as you are disabled.
Are you applying for Social Security.
No, not yet.
I need a little help figuring out what to do, Do you have a pamphlet book or something that can break things down for me.
Yes, we have a disability starter kit that helps prepare you for your interview or online application.
Ok, that sounds helpful, Are there any other helpful documents.
We do have one called "What you Need to Know When you Get Disablity Benefits".
Out of curiosity, how do I apply.
You can apply for benefits online or we have a toll-free number.
I want to circle back to the documents before I call, Tell me more about the publications.
The disability starter kit is available for adults and children under 18.
