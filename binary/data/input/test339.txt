You may be eligible for this benefit.
I may, Am I eligible for survivors pension or not.
You are eligible if you fulfill the conditions.
I haven't remarried after his death, Does that matter.
Of course, In this case you already meet one of the preconditions and you may be eligible.
So please tell me all about it, What are those conditions.
