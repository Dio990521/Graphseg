Hey there, good afternoon, Thanks for letting me to use this, I'm looking for some information about possible employment that can be enjoyed by any family members.
For that, your family member must go through a process and find out if they are eligible.
In any case, are you looking for educational and career counseling services provided by VR&E.
Yeah, precisely that.
Ok, then you may be eligible for those services, meeting the proper requirements.
Could you tell me more about it, how to apply.
First of all, go to your eBenefits account and log in, Then follow the proper steps.
O,k, and what kind of benefits can i get.
Well, first, you can get educational and vocational counseling, besides exploring your abilities and interests and mapping out a path to employment.
Very complete thing, huh,, Then again, how do i apply for this.
As said before, you can do that going online and using your eBenefits account.
Is any of your family members not using VR&E benefits and services yet.
No, no, they are using it.
