I need to arrange for a board hearing, I am not sure what to do next.
You would like to request a VA Board hearing.
Yes, that's what I want.
First thing you need is a Decision Review Request, Have you done that yet.
Yes, I already filled it out but I haven't heard back from them yet, How will I know if I have a hearing and when it is.
The Board of Veteran Appeals schedules hearings in the order that the requests are received, You will be notified at least 30 days prior to the hearing by mail, That mail will tell you when and where the hearing is to be held.
What if I need to tell them more about why they should let me appeal.
You can request a video conference hearing to give your testimony to a judge, They will add that information to your appeal file.
So now I just have to wait for the mail that tells me when the hearing is.
Yes, that is how you will be notified.
I already turned in the form, but is there a way to get another form in case I need it, I just want to be as prepared as possible.
Sure, the VA website has the form you need for download, It is titled Form 10182.
What if I want to mail in new evidence instead of the phone thing, Can I do that.
You can certainly do that too, You can send it my mail or fax, as long as it is sent within 90 days of your hearing.
