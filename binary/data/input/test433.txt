Good evening, Can i get information about gold plates, please.
Well, you can, I can say to you that DMV has issuing those plates since April 1, 2010, Also, you must know that DMV no longer issues those blue and white plates.
I see, So, in case i receive a new Golden ones, what do i do with those old blue and white ones.
You can send or get them to a local recycling facility, Visit the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation to see a list of such facilities.
Is there any security measure i must take regarding the plates disposal.
In fact, there are, You must make sure to separate your plates and put them in the recycle bin with some time between them, such as two weeks time.
Oh, right, quite obvious really, Is receiving these plates means that i'll get a new plate number.
That's correct, but you can retain your old plate number under certain conditions, Does your vehicle has its registration under one of the following classes: Passenger, commercial motorcycle or trailer.
Oh yeah, it has its registration under passenger.
Good, Then you can keep the same plate number from your current plates on your new Empire Gold plates, just paying a $2,00 additional fee.
Umm, o,k, that doesn't seems too much, I know i should have asked this before but, what do i need to get those plates.
You're certainly right about that, but do not worry, You may be able to get these plates when you apply to replace plates that are lost or stolen, or apply for a new original registration, or when you order new personalized plates.
