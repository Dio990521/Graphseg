just wanted to know about getting financial aid.
Okay, don't forget to try and accept the financial aid funds you won't have to pay back.
Has your school financial aid office sent you an aid offer.
no, haven't asked yet.
what about loans, any tips.
Make a budget so you borrow only what you need.
what does a promissory note do.
If you sign it you are promising to repay your student loan.
what do I do when they offer me financial aid.
You might have to sign the offer and mail it back to the school.
what if the aid offer is too complicated to understand.
Contact the school and make sure you understand what you're accepting.
