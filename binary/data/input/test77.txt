Hello I need information about How do you decide if an adult "child" is disabled to receive SSDI benefits.
Do you have a child 18 years or older.
Yes.
In that case we will assess your disability in the same way that we would assess disability for any adult, We send the request to Disability Determination Services in your state that completes the disability decision for us.
What other related information is there on this topic.
Among the related topics is the Apply for disability benefits under Child Age 18.
And another question, is the labor credit fixed or does it change.
The amount needed for a work credit changes from year to year, In 2019, for example, you earn one credit for every $ 1,360 in wages or self-employment income.
Where can I get more information about disability.
There are other publications on disability that I recommend you study.
And how do you evaluate a disabled child - adult.
We will assess your disability in the same way that we would assess disability for any adult.
