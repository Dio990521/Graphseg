Hello, I`m interested into knowing about if there are benefits for women who are veterans.
Are you a Veteran already.
No, i'm not, Just wanted to know that by curiosity.
But would you like to qualify fro those benefits.
Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing, Yes, i would like to qualify.
Very well, In case you qualify, You'll have access to top health services, which will be part of your benefits as a Veteran woman.
That sounds wonderful, So, can you tell me what kind of benefits i could get.
Sure, no problem, As a veteran woman, you can enjoy some general services, such as disease prevention or nutrition counseling and some services which are female specific.
That's simply great, i really mean it, Say, if i want to get these benefits using Veterans Affairs, What do i have to do.
For that, please contact your local Women Veterans Program Manager on your local VA med center, Or you can use our toll free number at 855-829-6636.
Good, I just have written down that, Sorry, you said before that thses benefits included female-specific services, don't you.
That's right, Some of them would be birth control, preconception counseling and menopausal support hormone replacement therapy.
