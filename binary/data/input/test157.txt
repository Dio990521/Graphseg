Hello, I'd like to know when a person is deemed disabled by your experts.
Yes, Disability Home.
Alright, Well, do you offer some publications with details on disability benefits.
Yes, we have a publication called "Social Security Disability Benefits", for example.
I'll give that one a read as soon as I can, When should I apply for disability benefits.
You should apply as soon as you become disabled.
Have you applied for disability benefits yet.
Yes, I did.
Then you should know that disability benefits will not begin until the sixth full month of disability, The Social Security disability waiting period begins with the first full month after the date we decide your disability began.
Yes, I've read about that on your page, Can you tell me when I can expect  to receive my supplemental security income.
We pay SSI disability benefits for the first full month after the date you filed your claim, or, if later, the date you become eligible for SSI.
Got it, Then this month might be a little tight at the end, Are there any other publications about disability benefits you'd recommend.
Yes, the Disability Starter Kit will help you get ready for your disability interview or online application, Kits are available for adults and for children under age 18.
