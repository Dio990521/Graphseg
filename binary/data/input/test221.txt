can you tell me what the next step is after the claim exam.
All the evidence in your file is reviewed, your disability rating is assigned, and we send you a letter letting you know your disability rating.
Did you want to get a copy of the final report from your exam.
no, I need more info.
is there more info on the exam out there that I can get my hands on.
Would you like to download some PDFs on the subject.
yes, I want to know more about it.
One that you might want is the VA claim exam fact sheet, It will guide you on what you can expect during and after the exam, and it can help make the process less stressful.
and do you have anymore info sources on what goes on after I file my claim.
You can learn how VA assigns disability ratings and how they affect your disability payments.
how do I schedule the exam once I am ready.
The staff at your local VA medical center or a local doctor’s office that we partner with will contact you, They will either send you a letter by mail with the date and time of your exam, or call you to find a time that will work for you.
will the doctor look at my claim to see what he has to look at.
The doctor may review your claim file with you.
