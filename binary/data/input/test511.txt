I lost my llicense.
Did you receive an order from DMV saying your license was revoked .
yes.
is there somewhere I can look at more info on this.
You can look at Alcohol or drug related violations.
what does it mean when they "revoke" my license.
It means your license has been cancelled and you must get a new one when the revocation period ends.
why wasn't it just suspended, what are some reasons for suspension.
You might get a suspension if you did not have automobile liability insurance OR if you were convicted of an alcohol or drugged driving charge.
if my license gets suspended for no insurance could I just send proof by email or to your online site.
Yes, you can submit proof of insurance online.
