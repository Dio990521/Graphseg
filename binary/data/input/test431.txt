Good afternoon, May i have clarification about some doubts i have with colored plates.
Very well, For starters, those plates has been issued since 2010, And in case you wonder, DMV no longer issues the blue and white types.
Well, that's interesting, because i was about to ask what could i do with some old plates of those colors.
In that regard, DMV doesn't have any more use for those colors, so if you receive gold plates, don't return the other ones to us, Intead, recyle them according to local procedures.
Oh right, oh right, So, how can i get those gold plates.
You can proceed in three different ways: By phone, online or at a DMV office, Mail will be used to sent you the separate documents.
And that's how ordering works then.
That's correct, just like i said to you a while ago.
Do you know how to avoid traffic tickets while you are waiting for your new plates.
No, i don't know that.
While you look for that, Can you tell me how i could locate this information on your portal.
Sure, You can locate it under the "Registration" topic.
