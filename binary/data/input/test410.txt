Okay, The first thing you should do is review the Graduated Driver License Law and restrictions for drivers under 18.

You can schedule the road test 6 months after the date you receive your learner permit.
What about a motorcycle learner permit.
You will need a supervising driver that will exercise general supervision and stay within one quarter mile of you while you ride the motorcycle.
Are there any restrictions on where I can drive with a learner permit.
Yes, While you have your learner permit, you won't be able to drive on any street within a park in New York City or on any bridge/tunnel under the jurisdiction of the Tri-borough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
How old does my superivising driver have to be.
Your supervising driver must be at least 21 years old and have a valid driver license.
