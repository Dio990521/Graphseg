Can you tell me about working while getting retirement benefits.
Sure, you know anything about it.
Not much, please tell me any relevant information.
This means that you can work while receiving Social Security retirement benefits or survivor benefits.
please, tell me more.
If you decide to work it could mean a higher benefit for you in the future.
What is the limit to what I can earn a year before getting my benefits deducted.
for 2019, that limit is 17,640$.
how much would I get deducted if I'm under full retirement age.
You'd get deducted 1$ for every 2$ you earn above the annual limit.
And if I earn more this year than the previous year.
then your benefits will get recalculated.
How do you check the earnings.
we review the records yearly for all working Social Security recipients.
