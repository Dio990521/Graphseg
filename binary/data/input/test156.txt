I came here because I need to know if I should wait with my application for social security.
First of all, you should apply as soon as you become disabled.
Do you plan to apply for Social Security.
No, at least not yet, I'm still gathering all documents I need for it.
Can you point me to some publications about disability benefits.
Of course, The Disability Starter Kit will help you get ready for your disability interview or online application, Kits are available for adults and for children under age 18.
That's good to know, Can I apply in another way, other than by mail, The next post office is far away from my home.
Yes, you can apply for Disability benefits online, or if you prefer, you can apply by calling our toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213.
Is that number for people hard of hearing, I have some problems understanding people sometimes.
People who are deaf or hard of hearing may call our toll-free "TTY" number, 1-800-325-0778, between 7 a,m, and 7 p,m, on Monday through Friday.
Those kits we talked about earlier, what do they contain.
The kits provide general information about the disability programs and our decision-making process that can help take some of the mystery out of applying for disability benefits.
Ah, interesting, And when can I expect the benefits to be paid.
We pay SSI disability benefits for the first full month after the date you filed your claim, or, if later, the date you become eligible for SSI.
