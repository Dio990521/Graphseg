I've been looking into some info for renewing a license, and would kie to know if there is some things i didn't see before.
Well, there is the use of the veteran status, Would you be interested into know about that.
Yes, that sounds interesting.
All right, Are you a veteran with honorable discharge and have a NYS driver license.
No, i don't have any of those.
I guess it doesn't need to be said, but, Can i get punishment if i drive while my license is expired.
Of course you will, Not only penalties but fines too, For example, you could pay a fine that range from $25 to $40, and you have to keep in mind that amount can be bigger.
Can i change my address and even so, i'll be able to receive my documentation.
You can indeed change your address, but we cannot guarantee that you'll receive your documents on your new address.
O,k, better to change that once i receive my document, Look, And those who are foreigners but have received an extension in their documents.
If you or one of your acquaintances is on that situation, then you or them must go to a DMV office with all your updated data, In that way, we'll update your record and your license will show your new temporary visitor expiration date.
