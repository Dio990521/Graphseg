Are you planning to retire early.
actually, yes.
You should know that you can retire any time between age 62 and full retirement age.
What would happen if I start my benefits early,.
What would happen to your benefits is that it would get reduced by a fraction of a percent for each month before your full retirement age.
And if I decide to dealy my benefits until after full retirement age.
then you may receive the benefit of getting delayed retirement credits that would increase your monthly benefit.
