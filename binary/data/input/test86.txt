Can you explain to me the rules of reviewing my disability.
Most of the time your benefits will continue as long as you are disabled and how often we review your case.
Would you like to know what happens if you have medical improvements.
No I do not have medical improvements.
Why would my benefits stop.
There are two things that will make it impossible to get benefits again or to continue them.
What is the law with reviewing my case.
The law states that we have to review your case from time to time to make sure you are still disabled,  We will let you know ahead of time that the review will be coming up.
What if I want to work again like most people.
That is good if you want to work again and not live off disability benefits.
Is there a way to keep my benefits and work.
Yes, we have special rules that let you work and keep your Medicare and cash benefits and we call these work incentives.
Are there any publications that would be helpful.
Yes we have one called Disability Benefits, What You Need to Know When You Get Social Security Disability Benefits, and How We Decide if You Still Have a Qualifying Disability.
