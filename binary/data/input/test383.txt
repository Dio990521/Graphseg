I want to self-certify.
What driving type will you be certifying.
Just for here in New york.
okay, we will need a copy of your USDOT Medical Examiners Certificate.
I have it but it is about to expire, is there a problem with that.
could be because you will not be certified to continue driving commercial vehicles if your certificate expires.
just bring in your new medical certificate so you are still certified,if it expires you will have to go to a DMV with your new certificate.
not expired yet, I'll stay up to date on it so it doesn't expire.
have you been previously certified then downgraded to not certified.
No , this is my first go.
what if I don't want to drive commercially but don't want to downgrade.
You don't need a Medical Examiner's certificate in that case but you will have restrictions on your CDL license.
Will anything happen if some of my info is wrong.
You might get rejected and they will let you know why, and you will have to correct the form or submit another one with the correct information.
okay, but I should have a medical examiner's certificate so do I need anything else to certify.
If you get the certificate you will be certified with no restrictions and all set.
