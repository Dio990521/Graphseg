Hello, good day, I would like to get some information related to do some changes on an IRP.
sure, no problem, Do you know which changes you want to do.
Not exactly, I want to know what can I do.
Do you want to know what to do to make the irp change.
Yes, that's right please.
To change your irp, you need to complete a schedule A&C irp-6 with the changes you want to do.
Do I need to provide any proof of identity or something.
Yes, you will need to proof your identity and provide also proof of ownership for all vehicles.
Great, But what about the fees and payments.
The IRB calculates the fees while you wait, and you be able to pay this in cash, by money order or certified check.
Do I have to do this in person, Can anyone else assist me.
Another person can helps you, but you need to see for a second-party registration application.
