I wanted to know what comes next after an appealed claim.
We can help you find out what happens after you request a decision review.
Did the VA schedule an exam for you.
yes they did.
Make sure you don't miss them.
can you tell me where to go to look at more about decision reviews.
We have a page for frequently asked questions about decision reviews, I can give you the link.
can I get help with the actual decision review itself.
A Veterans Service Organization, or VA-accredited attorney or agent can help you request a decision review, I can send you to the page where you can get more information on this.
can you tell me where I can get a form to appeal to the board.
You can ask a regional office for a copy of this form or you can call the VA toll-free hotline at 800-827-1000, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a,m, - 9:00 p,m, ET, to request a form.
and of the appeal options I can choose which would be the fastest one so I can get this over with.
If you want a Veterans Law Judge to review your case as quickly as possible, choose a Direct Review.
