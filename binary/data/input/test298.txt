Good afternoon, I was reading about possible effects of certain radiations on veterans, That could be worth of a disability benefit.
That's right, Under certain circumstances, you can get a disability compensation for illnesses including those derived by contact with radiation during military service.
O,k, So, what kind of benefits can i get.
You can get two types of benefits: Health care and Compensation payments.
I supposed there's some kind of requirements, isn't.
Correct, In any case, you must have an illness that is on our list of illness believed to be caused by radiation, or being verified by doctors.
Well, i have one of those.
Have your illness started within a certain period of time.
Yeah, that's right.
Good, Then you can be able to get disability benefits if you didn't receive a dishonorable discharge and you meet the requirements.
What kind of requirements if may i ask.
Well, for example, the following: Were a POW in japan; worked as an x-ray technician ordid tasks for DOE.
And how do i get those benefits.
You'll need to file a claim for disability, with medical records and service records.
