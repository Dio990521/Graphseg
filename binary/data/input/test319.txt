Hi, I am a disabled vet looking for information about independent living.
I can help with that, Are you able to perform daily activities without help.
Yes, I had to re-learn tasks, but I can do so now.
That's great, Congratulations, You may qualify for independent living.
Is it difficult to apply.
We can help you with your application online.
Am I able to work through the VR&E.
If you are a Veteran with a disability related to your service, you may qualify.
So how do I start getting my benefits.
First, you will need to go into your eBenefits account.
What happens if my disability prevents me from having some jobs.
Have you been classified as having a SEH.
I have not.
Well, in that case you may not qualify for VR&E benefits.
