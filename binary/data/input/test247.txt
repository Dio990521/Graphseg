Hello, I came here to find out how to opt in for my legacy claim.
Did you disagree with a VA decision you received before February 19, 2019.
Yes, I did.
In that case you can opt in to the modernized review system, after you've received a VA Statement of the Case SOC or Supplemental Statement of the Case SSOC.
I see, What do I need to do to get a statement of the case.
You must file a Notice of Disagreement VA Form 21-0958 within 1 year of the date on your decision.
Thanks, I'll do that, What does "duty to assist" entail, by the way.
VA's Duty to Assist requires VA to assist you in getting evidence, such as medical records, that is needed to support your case, VA's Duty to Assist applies during your initial claim and if you file a Supplemental Claim.
And what should I do next, after getting the SOC.
You have 60 days or the remainder of the 1-year period following the decision you appealed, whichever is later, to opt in to the modernized system by submitting one of the following forms and checking the SOC/SSOC opt-in box.
Let's say I missed the deadline for submitting my request, What should I do then.
You could add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim, for example.
Alright, makes sense, Can I download the forms on your page.
Yes, you can download the forms or learn more about decision review options on our page.
