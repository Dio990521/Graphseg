Hello, can you tell me the steps I need to take to renew a license.
Of course, Are you a veteran.
Yes, I am.
Are you a qualified U,S, military veteran who was honorably discharged, and do you have a NY State driver license, learner permit or non-driver photo ID card.
Yes, to all.
In that case you can have the word "Veteran" printed on the upper left hand of your photo document.
Ah, that's good to know, Say, what if my temporary visitor status has been extended.
Then you must go to a DMV office with your updated paperwork from the United States Department of Homeland Security DHS, We will update our records to show that your Temporary Visitor status has been extended so you can renew your license, Your new license will have your new temporary visitor expiration date.
Got that, What if it has been more than 2 weeks since my renewal.
Simply contact us.
Alright, I'll give the office a call after this conversation, Due to my military service I have moved a lot, between countries and states, Does my address have to match the one you currently have on record.
Yes, However, you can change your address online and then renew, There is no guarantee that the US Postal Service will forward your DMV documents to your new address.
