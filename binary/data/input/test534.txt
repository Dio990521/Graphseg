I'm here for a school loan deferment.
I can help you find out if a deferment is the best option for your situation.
what else can I do.
You can consider income-driven repayment.
can I do an economic hardship deferment.
Would you like to see if you qualify.
yes.
Are you receiving a means-tested benefit like welfare.
no we aren't.
Do you work full-time but have earnings that are below 150% of the poverty guideline for your family size and state of residence.
I don't think so.
Are you serving in the Peace Corps.
yes I am.
Okay, you qualify for this deferment.
so I won't be making payments.
You won’t have to make a payment, but you won’t be making any progress toward forgiveness or paying back your loan.
