Where should I start.
Are you retired.
No.
Did you know you can still work.
No I did not.
Can I work while getting survivors benefits.
You can work while you receive Social Security retirement or survivors benefits .
Is there a benefit to that.
When you do ,it could mean a higher benefit for you in the future.
How much can I earn and still get benefits.
If you are younger than full retirement age and make more than the yearly earnings limit , your earnings may reduce your benefit amount.
Are higher benefits better.
Higher benefits can be important to you later in life and increase the future benefit amounts your family and your survivors could receive.
