Hey, I have some questions about my benefits planner regarding my disability.
Of course, First, you should know that in most cases, you will continue to receive benefits as long as you are disabled.
I'm aware of that, What if I want to go back to work.
In that case you probably would rather work than try to live on disability benefits, like most people.
Yes, that's why I'm here, To figure out a way, So, will you review my disability first or how does it work.
How often we review your case, depends on whether your condition is expected to improve, Your benefits will continue as long as you are disabled.
(can't write a question).
No, that's not it.

So, in other words, if I work without issues, I might lose my benefits as my disability status might change.
