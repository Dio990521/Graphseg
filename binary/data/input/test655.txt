when do I get the money for my books.
Has you school provided a way for you to obtain your books and supplies by the seventh day of the term.
no that's why I'm here asking.
can you tell me what I can do if I can't get the ISBN number for my books.
If you can't get the ISBN then you can ask the school for the author, title, publisher, and copyright date.
when will a parent on a direct plus loan get the money for their daughter's school.
The school will give out the loan money by crediting it to the childâ€™s school account to pay tuition, fees, room, board, and other authorized charges.
how do I know if they should be giving me money for the books I need.
Are you eligible for disbursement 10 days before the term begins.
I guess not otherwise I would be getting my money.
Your school does not have to provide a way for you to obtain your books and supplies by the seventh day of the term.
