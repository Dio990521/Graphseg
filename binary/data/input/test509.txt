hi i would like to know if the suspension affects the driving privilege.
A suspension means that your driving license or privilege will be taken from you for a period of time, You may have to pay a suspension termination fee, Your suspension period may be final, having a start and end date, or indefinite, which does not end until you take the required action.
How long does a definitive suspensions last.
Yes.
received a definitive suspension.
do not.
was the traffic ticket issued anywhere else in New York State.
You must contact the local court directly, DMV The My License service can give you additional information on where to pay a traffic ticket.
and can I drive with a suspension.
You cannot drive until the period ends, pay a termination fee, and have a valid driver's license again.
What if the driver's license was issued in another state.
In that case the DMV may revoke your driving privilege in New York State, but your out-of-state license may still be valid for driving in other states.
