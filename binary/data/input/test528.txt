You can help me by answering a few questions I have regarding my application for the voter registration, That'd be really helpful.
Do you want to know if you're eligible to register to vote in New York State.
No, I don't.
Have you registered to vote in the past but do you need to update your voter registration information.
Yes, to both.
You do not need to update your voter registration information if your political party preference or name has changed since you last voted.
I see, And where can I find all of the voter registration requirements.
The full voter registration requirements are listed on the New York State Board of Elections website.
What should I do if I haven't received an answer after seven weeks, Because that is currently the case.
In that case you should contact them at the phone number or address provided on the New York State Board of Elections website.
Alright, I'll do that next then, And what can I do if the DMV has an old address of me on record.
Then you must first correct this information before processing an online Voter Registration Application, You will be asked to answer a series of voter registration application questions related to age, citizenship, prior voting history, and political party selection, and also your phone number optional for the Board of Elections, You will also be asked to affirm to the Board of Elections Affirmation.
