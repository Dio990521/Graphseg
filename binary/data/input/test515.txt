I have some questions regarding a suspended driving privilege, Perhaps you can answer some or even all of them.
Of course, A suspension means your license or driving privilege will be taken away for a period of time, You may need to pay a suspension termination fee, Your suspension period can be definite which has a beginning and end date or indefinite, which does not end until you take a required action.
That's good to know, What can you tell me about definite suspensions.
Have you received a definite suspension.
Yes, I have, Hence the questions.
In that case it will tell you how long the suspension period will last, You can not drive until the period ends, you pay a termination fee, and have a valid driver license again, You can use DMV's My License, Permit or ID service to check if your license is valid.
What if the vehicle is not insured and the registration is still valid.
Then you must surrender your registration and plates to DMV.
That's great and all, but how can I find out if my license is suspended.
Sign up for MyDMV and use the My License, Permit or ID service, A driving privilege is your legal authority to drive in a state other than the state that issued your driver license.
Well, what if the vehicle is not insured and the registration is still valid.
Then you must surrender your registration and plates to DMV.
