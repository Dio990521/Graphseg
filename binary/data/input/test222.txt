I have a VA claim exam coming up and I really don't know what to expect.
I can help you with that, First thing to know is that you don't need to bring anything with you.
Do you have any non-VA medical records from a recent surgery or illness that they should know about before the exam.
No, I don't have anything like that.
But I would like to know more about the exam process as well, Can you help me.
I can help you, Do you have any specific questions about the process that I can assist you with.
Is there anything about it I can download to read about in my own time.
Sure, We have a quick guide to the exam process, what to expect during and after your exam, and how to make the claim process easier and less stressful.
Those sound great, I would also like to know if you have information about what to do if the claim doesn't go in my favor and I have to appeal.
I can definitely give you more information on that, Did you have any specific questions.
Well first I want to know what happens after the exam so I know what to expect and what to do.
The first thing that will happen after the claim exam is that the doctor will write up a report and a VA claims processor will add it to your claim file.
