Hello, i need to get my own CDL driving record, what are the procedures to getting one.
Sure, but before proceeding, do you know how does a CDL work.
Can the CDL be made online, or is it strictly in an office.
It can be made online through MyDMV.
Is it free.
You have to pay a fee of $7.
What can i do if i ordered my CDL and i haven't received it yet.
Sadly, you only have the option of waiting for it to arrive, With that document you can create a MyDMV account.
What if i can't access MyDMV, What are other options to get my CDL.
You can mail a request for a Certified CDL Abstract PDF, The fee cost would be $10 instead of $7 or you can have your employer order your CDL through LENS.
What do i need to create an MyDMV account.
You will need a New York State license, permit or non - driver ID.
