I want to know how to make an update to my Federal Student Aid file.
Are you attempting to correct an error.
Yes I am.
If your application has already been processed, you can correct your FAFSA form online or on paper.
What information can I change on my form.
While most information can not be changed on the FAFSA form, some information must be updated if it changes, We have relevant information on the difference and how to update FAFSA information.
Does it make a difference if this is my first time getting Federal Student Aid.
If that is the case, you should expect to be required to sign a promissory note and go through entrance counselling.
How and when will I receive my financial aid.
The financial aid staff at your college or career school will explain exactly how and when your aid will be paid to you.
Will I have to pay this money back.
If it is a loan, yes, If it is a grant or scholarship, no, You need to decide what aid you really need, then respond to the school's aid offer within your school's deadline.
