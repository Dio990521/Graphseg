Good evening, My name is John, I'm a veteran and proudly served my country for many years, I came here because I need information about my primary care provider.
Of course, At VA, we take a team approach to health care with you at the center, Research shows this kind of approach leads to better quality care, more satisfied patients, and fewer hospital visits.
I see, And who will provide care for me.
Have you signed up for VA health care and chosen your main VA location.
Yes, to both, I've signed up for health care and I also chose a location near me.
In that case we'll assign you to a health care team called a Patient Aligned Care Team or PACT.
Alright, and who will this team consist of.
Your team will include a primary care provider your main doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant, a clinical pharmacist, a pharmacist who works with you and your primary care provider to make sure you're taking the medicines that are right for you and your overall health.
What if I'm already enrolled in VA health care.
Then we can help you find out how you may be able to receive care from a provider in your local community through community care.
And what if I want to switch to a different doctor.
In that case you'll need to talk to your health care team leader or to the patient advocate at your VA medical center.
