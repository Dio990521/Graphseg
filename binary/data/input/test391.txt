I need advice on what to do after receiving a traffic ticket.
have you received a ticket for a non-criminal moving traffic violation in the five boroughs of New York City.
No, I haven't.
Have you received any ticket.
Yes, I have.
There are instructions on the ticket that you must follow as soon as possible.
Did you don't answer the ticket in the time allowed.
Yes, I couldn't answer the ticket on time.
then your driver's license will be suspended and you could be found guilty of the charge due to your failure to respond a default conviction.
What are my options to pay for the hearing.
You can mail your payment, alongside with the requested information, to the Albany address listed on the back of the ticket, or you can bring your payment to any TVB office.
What would happen if I get more suspensions.
Your penalties will increase in the same way your suspensions increase, You can get suspended for not answering a ticket or for not paying a fine.
what could happen if I get more than 11 violation points.
if you get 11 or more violation points in a period of 18 months, your license could get revoked  or suspended after a hearing.
when would be added to my record the points from a violation.
the points are added in the date the violation occured and not the date you are found guilty.
