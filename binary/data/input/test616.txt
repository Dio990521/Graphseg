Hi there, I would like to get some help about loan application for parents.
Great, No problem, Do you know what is the direct plus loan application for parents.
Yes, I have done some research about it.
Awesome, but you need to know that this loan will depend on every school.
I was looking information related to a parent borrower, DO you have anything about this.
Yes, there is the possibility to be a parent borrower which allow you some benefits and possibilities.
Is possible to see how this works.
Yes, we can provide you a demo.
Great, and where I can see that.
You need to log in to start, this is very important.
Ok, but, this is something you can apply even with a security freeze on your credit file.
Yes, you can, But you will need to remove or lift your security freeze, because if not, your application won't be processed.
