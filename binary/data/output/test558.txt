how should I decide on what school aid to use.
You need to find out if you can get free money such as a grant or scholarship, or if you will need a loan.
what do I do next if I need that loan.
Decide what aid you really need, and then respond to the schoolâ€™s aid offer within the deadline set by the school.
Do I get the school money in a check or debit card.
Have you been offered financial aid that you accepted.
yes, I will get help.
The financial aid staff at your college will explain exactly how and when your aid will be paid out,  If you are receiving a federal student loan for the first time you should expect to be required to sign a promissory note and go through entrance counseling.
when do I get the aid they promised.
The timing of the aid offer varies from school to school and could be as early as winter awarding for the fall or as late as immediately before you start school, It depends on when you apply and how the school prefers to schedule awarding of aid.
