I have questions about getting a driver record abstract.
Are you trying to get a CDL driving record abstract.
Yes, that's what I need.
==========
Great, Your CDL abstract will show your expanded driving history information that can't be found on your Standard Driving Record.
Can I get my CDL abstract online.
==========
Yes, You can download a PDF version of your record for a $7 fee, After you order, you will have 5 days to download your record to save and/or print it.
How do I get it online.
==========
You will need to create a MyDMV account, To create the account, you will need a NY State icense, permit, or non-driver ID.
It's saying I need a document number, but I haven't received it in the mail yet, What do I do.
You will have to wait for the document to arrive before you can create your MyDMV account.
What if I can't access MyDMV.
If you don't have access to MyDMV, you can mail a Request for Certified CDL Abstract PDF MV-CDL form and the $10 DMV to the address on the form, You can also get your employer to order it through LENS.
