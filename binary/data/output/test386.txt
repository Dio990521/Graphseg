I'm looking at recovering my vehicle.
Ok, was it stolen or lost.
My vehicle was stolen but it's recovered now.
Ok, firstly make sure the police have closed the file and documented it was returned to you.
==========
It has been,  Do I need to get my insurance company to sign it back over to me.
Yes, both with the claim documentation as well as the title.
What if it was totaled.
==========
Your insurance company can handle that, We can process the re-registration for the vehicle itself but your insurance company wil handle the claim.
So I shouldn't reapply for plates until everything is done w/ my insurance.
==========
That is correct.
Can I get the polcie to give me a form MV-78B for this.
Yes but that will go along with your insurance documentation.
==========
What if the plates were stolen too.
Bring that copy of your registration as well as that MV-78B.
