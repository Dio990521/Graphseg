I'm helping an Army vet who thinks that he was exposed to biological weapons while in the service and we want information.
Okay, we can help you find out it they can get disability compensation and other benefits for illnesses or other conditions, These are illnesses and conditions that may have been caused by contact with harmful chemicals or other hazardous materials while serving in the military.
==========
was the person you are helping involved in chemical and biological testing.
yes, he said biological weapons.
was he one of the Veterans that volunteered for medical research for the U,S, biological and chemical programs between 1942 and 1975 .
no he said it happened later.
do you have a site we can visit or a number we can call if we have more questions later.
You can visit the U,S, Army web page or call 800-984-8523.
==========
is agent orange one of the things that were used.
It might have been one of the things they were in contact with, If they served in the Republic of Vietnam or in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone during the Vietnam Era or in certain related jobs they may have had contact with Agent Orange, an herbicide used to clear plants and trees during the war.
==========
he also thinks he got sick because of asbestos besides the weapons, so is that possible.
Yes, there is a possibility he may have had contact with asbestos while working in certain military jobs, Asbestos toxic fibers were once used in many buildings and products.
