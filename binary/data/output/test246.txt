hi i need help about What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer.
Have you requested an informal conference with a senior reviewer about the Top Level Review option.
do not.
==========
Do you know what will be done if nobody answers the calls of the superior reviewer.
no, I don't know that information.
==========
What if I received a SOC or SSOC on the issue in your Notice of Disagreement.
You have 60 days or the remainder of the 1-year period after the decision you appealed, whichever is later, to opt for the modernized system by submitting one of the following forms and checking the SOC / SSOC checkbox:     Request for Decision Review: VA Supplemental Claim Form 20-0995.
==========
what can happen no one answers calls from the top reviewer.
in that case they will leave a voicemail.
==========
And in the conversation that I will have with the judge, will my representative be able to participate.
of course if you have one this can help you in the audience.
==========
What do I do If I request a Board Appeal and want to change to a different appeal option.
You can submit a new Board Appeal form with a different option selected, You can change your appeal options within 1 year from the date of your VA decision or 60 days from the date you sent your original form, You cannot select a different appeal option if you have already presented evidence or had a hearing.
