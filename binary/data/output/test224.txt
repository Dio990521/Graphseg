When you get the exam it helps us rate your disability and that severity of your disability will affect how much disability payment you will get.
How long will it take after the VA claim exam to get my disability rating.
Every claim is unique but it should normally take about 3-4 months to process a claim from beginning to end and it depends on the complexity of the claim.

Who will do the exam for the VA claim.
A VA doctor or a non-VA doctor who we contracted with will do your exam; but you may have your own doctor examine you and fill out the proper forms.
