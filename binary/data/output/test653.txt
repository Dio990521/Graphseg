If my school closes while I enroll, can I be eligible to be discharged from my federal student loan.
you need to know the discharge eligibility requirements and how you can apply.
I want to be eligible for a 100 percent down payment on my William D, Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program loans.
Were you enrolled when your school closed.
was not enrolled.
Were you on an approved leave of absence when your school closed.
I was not on leave.
Did your school close within 120 days of retirement.
not my case either.

We are sorry to tell you that you may not be eligible for the loan program.
I understand and can you give me details of the registration process.
You must contact your loan administrator about the application process for your loan to be canceled.
