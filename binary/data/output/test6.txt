I need a Social Security card or number for my daughter.
Okay, it is important that we verify a birth record for all U,S , born applicants who apply for an original Social Security number, Exceptions are made for parents who apply for a baby's Social Security number at the hospital when the baby is born.
Did you need to know how we verify birth records.
yeah, what do I do to verify.
What else will I need besides birth records, do we need to show proof of identity.
We will need evidence that shows the child continues to exist beyond the date of birth , We only accept certain documents as proof of your child 's identity, Documents must show your child's name , identifying information such as ,age , date of birth , or parents ' names and preferably a recent photograph, We may accept a non - photo ID  document if it has enough information to identify the child such as the child 's name and age , date of birth, or parents ' names .
==========
What if we don't have those things like ID or passport.
You could use a state issued non - driver 's identification card or an adoption decree.
==========
OK, what if we lived in Mexico for some time, will you accept papers from there.
If your child lived outside the United States for an extended period , you could use a current or previous passport ,school and/or employment records ,and any other record that would show long - term residence outside the U,S, to show that your child does not have a Social Security number and needs one.
and do I need a birth certificate.
If you have or can get a U,S ,- State - Issued birth certificate that recorded his or her birth before age 5 then you must submit it.
==========
and will all this help with being able to claim an adopted kid for tax reasons.
If you want to claim your child for tax purposes while the adoption is still pending , contact the Internal Revenue Service for Form W-7A , Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U,S, Adoptions .
