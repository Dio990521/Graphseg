I need to get some information about VA Survivors Pension, please.
VA Survivors Pension offers monthly payments to qualified surviving spouses and unmarried dependent children of wartime veterans who meet certain income and net worth limits set by Congress.
am I eligible for a VA Survivors Pension as the child of a deceased wartime veteran.
Are you either unmarried and under the age of 18 or under the age of 23 and attending a VA-approved school or unable to care for yourself due to a disability that happened before you were 18.
I believe that I meet two of those qualifications,  I am 16 and dependent on a wheelchair and assistance bathing and dressing myself as well as other household tasks.
==========
You may indeed be eligible for this benefit.
Am I understanding that my age and my disability could definitely qualify me for a VA Survivors Pension.
Are you indeed 16 and disabled.
I am.
==========
Then, as previously stated, you may very well qualify for the benefit on those conditions and as the child of a deceased wartime veteran.
Are there any other qualifications.
Your yearly family income and net worth must meet certain limits set by Congress,  Your net worth equals the value of everything you own except your house, your car, and most home furnishings, minus any debt you owe.
