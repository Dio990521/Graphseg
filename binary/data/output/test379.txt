==========
Does it ever expire.
I just want to know as I'm leaving the country for a few months and don't want to have to do it iagain.
As long as the monitoring agency is still valid and reports it to the DMV, you will be fine.
==========
What happens if I have to switch courses.
If you already have a valid license, you don't have to worry about them.
==========
Do I need supervised road training before I take my test.
If under the age of 18, yes; 50 hours.

Any valid licensed driver.
