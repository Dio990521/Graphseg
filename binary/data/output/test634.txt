Hi, I would like to know if you may be eligible for the cancellation of your federal student loans based on a false certification.
Well you need to learn more about fake certification approval to see if you can qualify.
Can I choose which part or all of my primary PLUS loan could be canceled.
Did your school falsely certify your student ability to benefit from your training.
no not yet.
Did you have disqualification status at the time the school certified your eligibility for the Parent PLUS Loan.
no neither.
==========
Did your school sign your name on the promissory note or other loan documents without your authorization.
yes that yes it did.
in this case your may be eligible for the PLUS loan.
When you meet the eligibility requirements for a discharge, will the remaining balance of your loan be canceled.
yes and any payment made on the loan will be refunded.
