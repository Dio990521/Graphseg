Can you help me renew my FAFSA application.
Sure, I'm guessing you already know you need to renew it every year.
Do you know how to do it.
I know a bit of the process but not all.
Have you already logged in to do the renewal.
I have, yes.
Then you can see that there's already some information from your previous academic year prefilled in the renewal form.
==========
Is it the same if I do it from the mobile app.
Yes, in that case, is faster since the renewal form displays itself automatically if you are eligible for renewal.
==========
What should I do in case I forget my FSA password in the future.
You can check the option on what to do if you forget your ID or password.
==========
Ok, so do I need to provide any other info apart from the prefilled one on the renewal form.
just your new income and tax information and any other information that needs to be updated.
