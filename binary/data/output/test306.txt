how much do we get in benefits if someone were to sign up now.
Some example are; schools could provide $ 1,000 for undergraduates , $ 1,500 for graduate students , and $ 2,000 for doctoral students, The school also could provide $ 1,800 for students in the school of engineering and $ 2,500 for students in the school of nursing .
