Can you tell me about enhanced eligibility for returning combat veterans.
Of course, You can receive free VA health care for up to 5 years after discharge or release for any condition related to your service in Operation Enduring Freedom OEF in Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF or Operation New Dawn OND in Iraq, This is called an enhanced eligibility period.
I see, Should I apply right away or wait.
Are you planning to wait to apply for VA health care until after your enhanced eligibility period ends.
==========
No, I haven't really thought about it, to be honest.
What conditions do I need to meet for enhanced eligibility.
Have you served in a theater of combat operations after November 11, 1998.
No, I haven't.
==========
I'm afraid you don't qualify for enhanced eligibility then, I'm sorry.
Oh, that's too bad, But what if I'm a member of the National Guard.
In that case your coverage options will depend on your military status before you separate, You'll have 90 days from your separation date to change your health plan.
