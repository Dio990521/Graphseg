Hi there, I'm looking information about how much I need to take my road test once I get my learner permit.
No problem, Are you under 18.
Yes, that's right.
In that case, You need to wait at least 6 months from the date you received your learner permit to schedule your road test.
But I will still need supersion of someone.
That's right, You may not drive unless you be accompanied by a supervising driver age 21 or older with valid licence.
But what happens if I have a learner permit for a motorcycle.
In that case your supervising driver must exercise general supervising of you while drive, remain within one to quarter mile of you.
is that really necessary.
Yes it is, It's very important that you understand the graduated driver license law the restrictions on drivers under age 18.
Even if is a little motorcycle as a moped.
That's right, The same passenger rules apply, The law is for everyone.
