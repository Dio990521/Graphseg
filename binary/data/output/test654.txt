Hi, What are the eligibility requirements for a discharge of my student loan if my school closes.
If your school closes while you are enrolled with them or soon after you withdraw you may be eligible for discharge of your federal student loan.
I have loans with the same school or different programs,  Before I could complete any of the programs my school closed, What happens in a case like this.
In a case like yours only loans you received for a program that you were unable to complete because of the school's closure are eligible for discharge.
What happens if I enrolled for say Program A but decided not to continue with Program A and then transferred to Program B.
==========
In that case as you were unable to complete Program B because the school close only the loans you received for Program B may be discharged.
If my school closes which loans are eligible for discharge.
Do you have a William D, Ford Federal Direct Loan, a Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) or a Federal Perkins Loan.
==========
Yes I have one of those loans.
In that case you may be eligible for a 100 percent discharge of your loan if your school closes.
My school closes and I need a copy of my academic transcript, Where can I get this.
You should contact the state licensing agency in the state where the school was located to find out if the state has the records.
