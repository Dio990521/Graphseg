Hi, I need to know how soon I can apply for disability.
You should apply as soon as you become disabled.
You are wanting to apply for Social Security disability benefits, correct.
Well, I am really not sure if that's what I am doing, I am not really sure what I am applying for exactly.
Where do I go to apply anyway.
You can apply either online, or over the phone by calling 1-800-772-1213.
==========
Just so I know what I am applying for and what I need to do, is there anything I can read.
We have a Disability Starter Kit available that will help you get ready to apply, We have kits available for adults and for children under 18.
Will the starter kit tell me what information I need to have to apply.
Yes, it tells you want documents and information will be necessary for you to have for the application process.
If I do apply for Social Security, how soon will they send me benefit money.
You will get your first payment on the sixth full month of your disability.
