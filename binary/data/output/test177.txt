I have some questions regarding my social security credits and could use some help with that.
Of course, You must earn at least 40 Social Security credits to qualify for Social Security benefits, You earn Social Security credits when you work and pay Social Security taxes.
Wait, does this mean I get more money if I have more credits.
==========
The number of credits does not affect the amount of benefits you receive.
So I don't get more if I have more credits.
No, credits only determine if you are eligible or not, You do not get extra benefits for earning more than the minimum number of credits.
Alright, now I understand, How many credits would I need for survivor benefits.
The number of credits needed for family members to be eligible for survivors benefits depends on your age when you die, The younger you are,  the fewer credits needed.
Are you already receiving retirement or disability benefits.
No, I'm not.
==========
I'm also statutorily blind, how does that affect my work test.
You must only meet the duration of work test.
