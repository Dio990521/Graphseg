Why would I need to provide required verification for my FAFSA application.
If you have received a note on your SAR saying you have been selected for verification or you school contacted you then you just have to confirm that the data reported on the FAFSA form is accurate.
Have you been selected for verification.
I have not been notified that I need verification.
==========
What if I decide I want to get a loan to pay back.
First, decide what aid you really need, and then respond to the school aid offer or choose to get a loan to pay back.
==========
What can I change of the FAFSA form if it has changed.
Some information must be updated if it changes but not on the FAFSA form and you can find out how to online.
What if I used the IRS Data Retrieval Tool when filling out your FAFSA form.
==========
Then you may not have to verify that information and your school may require you to submit an IRS tax transcript or a signed copy of your income tax return as part of the verification process.
How do I know how much aid I will get.
The school will calculate your aid and send you an electronic or paper aid offer or award letter telling you how much aid you are eligible for.
