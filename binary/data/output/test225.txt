Hey i'm interested into filing a disability claim, I know there's some exam after the claim but, What happens next, after the exam.
Pretty simple, Your claim will be reviewed by us, then we'll assign your claim a disability rating and finally, will send you letter with a decision notice, so you can know your disability rating.
did you know that you can get a copy of the final report from your exam.
No, i didn't knew that.
Will i receive my exams directly.
Sorry, but no, The doctor will handle those to our claims processors, Those professionals will decide your claim based on those results, along other significant medical and military records.
Are there any educational or instructive tool that i can use to prepare for my exam.
Sure, You may refer to our Veterans claim exams video series, in which you'll find information about how to prepare for your exam, how to use disability benefits questionnaires and what to expect in the exam itself.
That sounds helpful, but right now i don't have any visual device, don't you have something to read instead.
No problem, you can download some documentation, such as VA claim exam fact sheet, or a quick guide on the claim exam process or what you can expect during and after your exam.
These exams are made because you need some additional info, right.
That's right.
