Hello, I have questions regarding the Benefits Planner for my retirement.
Would you like to know about benefits for your family.
No, thank you.
Would you like to hear more about maximum family benefits then.
Yes, that would be great.
==========
Very well, Does one of your children qualify for benefits.
No, my children don't qualify for benefits, Sorry.
I'm more interested in benefits for my partner, Can you tell me about that.
Of course, Even if they have never worked under Social Security, your spouse may be able to get benefits if they are at least 62 years of age and you are receiving or eligible for retirement or disability benefits, our spouse can also qualify for Medicare at age 65.
I see, What about other family members, What if any of my family members apply for benefits with me.
Well, in that case we will ask you for their Social Security numbers and their birth certificates.
