Hello there, I am looking information related to the planning of the retirement.
Great, Do you have clear what is the government pension offset.
Yes, I have big part of the information related to this.
Do you know if you will receive a pension for work not covered by social security.
No, not really, I don't think so.
==========
Great thanks, It is possible to meet for an exception.
To apply for an  exception or see if you can apply, the best thing you can do is to read "when won't my social security benefits reduced," section.
==========
Great, I would like to know now about which benefits could receive my spouse and the estimations.
You mean, the amount your spouse can receive at full retirement age.
==========
No exactly, I mean before that.
OK, no problem, But you already know the amount your spouse may receive.
I don't have it very clear yet.
Then, is not possible to give you a estimated amount of how much would your spouse receive.
