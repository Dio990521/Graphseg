Hello there, How are you doing, I have some questions about making changes to an IRP registration.
Would you like to know what common changes you can make to IRP registrations.
==========
Sure, why not.
You can add or delete vehicles, transfer plates from one vehicle to another or add jurisdictions, for example.
Well, yes, I wanted to transfer a plate, but I'll get to that, First, I would like to know something else, Can I also apply by mail.
Yes, If you do, the IRB sends you a invoice.
==========
What about applying by fax, Is that an option.
Of course, Simply submit the Schedule A&C (IRP-6) by fax to 518-486-6579, IRB processes changes submitted by fax within 72 hours.
What if I want to make changes to my IRP registration.
Simply complete Schedule A&C (IRP-6) and submit it for all changes, You'll need to provide a proof of identity for all changes and a proof of ownership for all add vehicle requests.
Is it also possible to do all of this online.
Yes, you can make some changes to your IRP registrations using OSCAR.
