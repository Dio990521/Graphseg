what can you tell me about the disability benefits.
I can tell you that it's always a good idea to plan ahead for disability benefits because you never know when you can needed.
and what would be the medical requirements for the Social Security disability insurance and the SSI program.
The medical requirements are the same for both programas, aswell as the way we determine who qualifies.
==========
Would the disability insurance program cover my adult child.
only if your child's disability started before age 22.
What information should I give when appliying for any of the programs.
==========
You will be asked for your medical condition, work and education history to help us decide if you qualify as disabled under our rules.
Is there any other important information needed for attorneys helping others get their benefits.
Are you an attorney helping someone else apply online for the benefits.
Not really, Was just curious.
