I understand but how can I calculate the net price.
You must follow a few simple steps to calculate your net price, or net cost, for each school.
ok and one of the steps is the cost of attendance but does it all include it.
If you do not include it, request this figure from the financial aid office, Make sure it includes the amounts you will pay directly to the school, such as tuition and fees, as well as other costs, such as living expenses, books and supplies, and transportation.
If I don't understand what's in your offer of help.
contact the school financial aid office.
