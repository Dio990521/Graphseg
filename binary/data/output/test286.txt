Hello, I need to know if I'm eligible for Veteran's pension.
Of course, As you might already know, the Veterans Pension program provides monthly payments to wartime Veterans who meet certain age or disability requirements, and who have income and net worth within certain limits.
Are you eligible for Veterans Pension benefits from VA.
Yes, Yes, I am.
Do you meet the VA pension eligibility requirements.
No, well, not all of them.
What were the requirements again.
==========
Did you NOT receive a dishonorable discharge.
Yes, I didn't receive a dishonorable discharge, Why.
Does your yearly family income and net worth meet certain limits set by Congress.
Yes, it does.
In that case you may be eligible for the Veterans Pension program.
