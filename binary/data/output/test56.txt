What are the next steps if I do not qualify for benefits on someone else's records.
Even when you do not qualify for benefits on someone else's record, we could use your record and maybe some members of your family may qualify this way.
What if I want to find out more info about benefits for my family.
Do you know you could look for benefits about your family under "Benefits For Your Family".
No, I did not know this was available to me.

Have you never been married or had children.
No, I am married and have children.

Then you probably won't qualify for benefits on someone else's record.
Is there a chance benefits paid to me as a spouse will decrease what my spouse at retirement will get.
Actually the value of the spouse's benefits you receive, could be added to their benefits and may help your spouse decide to take benefits sooner.
What is the amount you could pay family benefits.
The total depends on your spouse's benefit amount and how many family members that would qualify on the same record.
