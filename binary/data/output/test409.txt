Hello, I'm searching information related with drivers around the age of 18.
Are you under 18 or are the parent of a driver under age 18.
No, I'm not under 18, but I know someone who is.
I wanted to know if someone under 18 have any kind of restriction when to drive if is just a moped bike.
==========
Yes, the rules for passengers applies too.
That's something that even applies when this person has a learner permit.
==========
Yes, of course, There must always be a supervising driver, who must exercise general supervision all the time while the motorcycle is operated.
But this person can drive to everywhere right.
No, not really, With a learner permit you can not drive on any street within a park in new york city or any bridge or tunnel.
And once this person be over 18.
This person will need to wait at least 6 months from the date when he or she received the learner permit to schedule his or her road test.
