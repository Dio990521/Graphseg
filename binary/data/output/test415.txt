You are not required to pay all of your civil fines in one transaction, but you cannot be approved for a new driver's license or the restoration of your driving privilege until you pay all of the civil fines you owe.
If the order was issued between July 1, 1990 and October 31, 1996, what would be the fine.
the civil fine would be $ 500.
Can additional fines be paid in a single section.
You can return to the transaction later to pay additional civil penalties.

And if it is by check, where should I send it.
I must send it to the NYS DMV6 Empire State Plaza Driver Improvement Unit, Room 338 Albany, NY 12228 474 - 0774.
