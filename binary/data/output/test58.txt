Hello there, I came here to find out what documents I will need to get a replacement card for my child, My boy hasn't been born on American soil, which makes this a little difficult.
First of all you'll need a proof of citizenship.
Have you previously reported the child's U,S, citizenship to us.
No, I haven't.
==========
So, what documents do I need to provide.
You can provide a U,S, driver's license, for example.
==========
What about another state issued card.
Yes, you can also provide another state-issued non-driver identification card.
The details on the card might be a few years old, is that alright.
==========
Yes, an acceptable document must be current, not expired, and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph.
And then I can get the card replaced for free, right.
Of course, You can replace your child 's Social Security card for free if it is lost or stolen.
