Hi, good afternoon, I want to get some info about the retirement benefits planner.
Information about the online calculator.
==========
No, not about that, I know something already.
what i want to know is if the planner include any new benefits as is created or increased.
Yes, the online calculator gets updated in regular basis with all the new benefit increases and other benefit amounts, That, of course, will affect whatever estimate you could get currently.
I thought that but wanted to be sure, Another thing is, what happens if my birthday is on January 1st, As non working day, does the system has any problem there.
In that case, the calculator will figure out your benefit as if your birthday was in the previous year.
==========
Um, the things about technology, huh,, All right, then, How can i get a more accurate estimate.
For that purpose, please make use of the detailed calculator.
OK, i'll look into it later, Oh, by the way, you said before the calculator wasn't to have any problem with my birthday date, for being on January 1st, didn't you.
That's correct, The calculator will figure out that taking the benefit as if your birthday was in the previous year.
A last thing, please, What do i need to enter in the calculator.
That's simple, You only need to enter all your past earnings, If you need to find that out, just check your online account.
