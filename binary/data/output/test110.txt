Very good, Thant you can change and update your information anytime, anywhere just logging in to My Social Security account.
So, for which reasons do i need to change that address.
You are asked to do that, once you get social security benefits such as retirement, survivor or disability, You only need to log in and update you information.
It takes too much creating a My Social Security account.
==========
Not at all, it only takes less than 10 minutes.
Ok, then once created i can change my personal info, huh.
That's correct, You'll be able to change any of that.
