I would like to know what are the employment or volunteer services that qualify for the cancellation of the Perkins loan.
Do you want to opt for a Perkins loan.
if I want to choose.
you work as a provider of early childhood education.
not related to that.
Are you an employee of a children's or family services agency.
no neither.
Are you a faculty member at a tribal college or university.
Yeah that's right.
==========
in this case if you may be eligible for a Perkins loan.
Can my loan be canceled for teaching at a private school.
good if the private school has established its nonprofit state with the Internal Revenue Service, and if the school is providing primary or secondary education in accordance with state law.
