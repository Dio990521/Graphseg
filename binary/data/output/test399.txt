Good day, I'm planning to move from NY to Alabama, My questions is what do I need to do with my plates.
Do you want to register your vehicle in another state.
Yes, I do.
==========
In that case you must surrender your vehicle registration and plates to the New York DMV.
I already registered my car in Alabama, but you sent me a letter about a lapse of insurance, What now, Do I need to send you proof.
Yes, All proof must include the name and address of the registrant, and the year, make and vehicle identification number VIN of the vehicle, We will apply your proof to the NY record to reduce or clear a lapse of insurance coverage reported by your insurance company.
==========
Do I need to return my old plates if my car is registered in Alabama.
Yes, immediately surrender your vehicle registration and plates to the DMV.
Wait, what if my insurance coverage is done by an insurance in Alabama.
==========
If your insurance coverage in NY lapses, we will take actions against your New York State registration and driver license even if you move out of New York, This can affect your ability to have a driver license in your new state.
Alright, this is interesting, So if I have a car registered in NY, can it be covered by my insurance in Alabama.
No, that is not possible.
==========
Is your vehicle registered in New York State.
No, it is registered in Alabama, I was just wondering about this.
