I was supposed to submit a request but I missed the deadline, What do I do,.
The deadline date is set to help you receive the maximum benefits if your case is granted, You need to check the dates and have them submitted before then.
However, you may still be able to submit it after the deadline date.
==========
How do I do that, I really need these benefits and I am freaking out over here.
I feel so bad about not finishing on time, I knew the date but I was still gathering evidence and not all of it got back to me in time, Can I still use it.
==========
Yes, you can add the evidence as a Supplemental Claim.
I think I missed the deadline due to an error on the VA's end, How do I prove that.
To prove a CUE error, you must show the correct facts and be able to prove that the VA incorrectly applied the law at that time.
==========
Can the VA help me to gather all the right evidence.
Yes, they are required to help you if you need it on your claim.
Do they have to help with me a supplemental claim too.
Yes, they help with the original claim and any supplemental claims.
