I need to get a replacement non-driver ID card.
I can help you with that, Be adviced that you cannot get a replacement ID if it was expired.
I'm getting ready to go on vacation, Should I get a REAL ID.
Yes, it is recommended that you go to DMV to obtain a REAL ID before you travel.

Okay, I have another question, A friend of mine lost his driver's license and needs to have it replaced, He's turning 21 in 3 months, Will it still say under 21 on his license.
Yes, It will still say under 21 on his driver license.
What if I'm out of the country and need to have my ID replaced.
Do you plan to take an overseas trip in the near future.
No, It will be later this year.
==========
Why is it recommended to get a REAL ID before I travel.
It's just a matter of convenience, Getting the REAL ID when you go to have your ID replaced will be easier than having to make a second trip to DMV later.
