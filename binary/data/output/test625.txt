Hi there, I'm looking information related to how to fill the the fafsa form, and the information that I need to put on it.
Sure thing, no problem, You most be sure that you add at least one school on your fafsa form, so your information to helps to determinate the type and amounts of aid you may receive.
==========
This also applies for the state of indiana.
Yes, it applies for every state, you just need a eligible school in state college to be considered for state grand aid.
==========
The order of the schools I list is important.
have you been filling your form considering the schools in a certain order.
==========
Yes, I have been putting my main chooses at the top of the application.
Alright, Well that's not really necessary, SOme states require it, but you need to check the list.
Ok, that's great, But How many schools can I list.
You can list up 10 schools online or in the app, or 4 on your pdf fafsa form.
And what happens if I have to update my school choices later.
You'll have to notify your state agency by changing your institution on some states.
