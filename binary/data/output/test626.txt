I am wondering what information to include on my FAFSA form in relation to nominating a college to receive my information.
Any school that you list on the FAFSA form will use the information from this form to determine the types and amounts of financial aid that you may receive.
Is there a particular order that I must put my list of schools in on my FAFSA form.
The schools that you list must be in-state in order to be considered for state grant aid, There is no impact on your eligibility with the order that you give to these schools.
Should I list the schools on my list in my preferential order, or does this matter.
Are you looking to apply for federal student aid.

Am I able to update the school choices on my list at a later date on my FAFSA form.
