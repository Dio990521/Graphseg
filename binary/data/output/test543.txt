Do I have to renew my FAFSA application.
Yes, if you want to keep receiving the benefits you have to renew it every year.
Do you need help on how to renew your FAFSA application.
Yes, please.
Can you log in to renew your FAFSA form.
Not right now.
==========
But I can do it later from the myStudentAid app.
Ah, that's even better, Once you log in as a student on the app the renewal form will automatically display if you are eligible for renewal.
What should I do to be sure that I'm always eligible for renewal and to get the most from it,.
==========
Just be sure to renew your form each year and to meet the FAFSA deadlines for state and college aid.
So, I need to do this every year, right.
Correct, every academic year that you still want to get the economic aid.
