I have a repair problem with my van, can you answer a few questions about that.
Of course, First, attempt to resolve the issue with the management of the business, Keep a written record of all contacts with management in addition to details about the repair.
Do you want to submit a complaint electronically.
Yes, that'd be great.
==========
In order to do so, download the complaint report available at the link above to your personal device, Attach and then email the completed report as well as any supporting documents to our email address, Please note that DMV staff will communicate with you through email.
Can I inspect my van after it was repaired to make sure they didn't screw me over.
Yes, You have the right to inspect your vehicle at the shop before paying for repairs, However, this does not give you the right to remove the vehicle from the shop without paying for the repairs, or to inspect it in areas where only authorized employees are allowed.
==========
What if I have received a court settlement.
In that case, I'm afraid, restitution through DMV is not available.
==========
That's a pity, Can you tell me about this repair shop act I heard about.
Gladly, Under the Repair Shop Act, thousands of dollars are returned to consumers each year through mediation and restitution.
==========
Oh, that is interesting, Can you give me any additional information about this.
