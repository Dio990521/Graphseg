Hello there, I hope you're having a great day, Can you tell me about enhanced eligibility for returning combat veterans.
Of course, You can receive free VA health care for up to 5 years after discharge or release for any condition related to your service in Operation Enduring Freedom OEF in Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF or Operation New Dawn OND in Iraq, This is called an enhanced eligibility period.
==========
Free health care sounds great, Should I apply right away or can it wait a while.
Are you planning to delay your application for VA health care.
No, I will apply as soon as possible.
==========
Can I use your health care offer while I'm on active duty then.
Yes, you may be able to use VA health care under certain conditions.
That's good to know, But back to the enhanced eligibility, what are the requirements for that.
Have you served in a theater of combat operations after November 11, 1998.
No, I didn't.
Then I'm afraid you don't qualify for enhanced eligibility, I'm sorry.
That's quite a disappointment, But while I'm here, what were the conditions for VA health care on active duty.
*makes no sense*.
