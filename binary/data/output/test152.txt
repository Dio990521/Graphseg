When should I apply for disability benefits.
You should apply as soon as you become disabled.
Will you be applying for Social Security disability benefits.
Yes, that is what I want to do.
==========
You will want to apply as soon as possible, Once approved, it takes until the sixth full month of disability for benefits to begin.
Is that the same amount of time that it takes for SSI payments too.
For Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments, they become available on the first full month after you file your claim or the date you become eligible for SSI.
==========
How do I apply.
You can either apply online, or through our toll-free phone number: 1-800-772-1213.
==========
Is there anything I can read that will give me more information, I want to make sure I do this right.
Yes, of course, The Disability Starter Kit has all the information you need to help you get ready to apply, There is a kit for adults and a kit for children under age 18.
I know you said that SSI gets paid a month after the claim is filed or the date I become eligible, but what if those are two different dates, Which one do they go by.
We go by the later of the two dates, which is why it is better to file as soon as possible.
