If you teach full-time and meet all the other qualifications you may be eligible for forgiveness of up to $17,500 on your student loan.
I have a Direct Consolidation Loan, does this qualify.
Yes, you may be eligible for forgiveness of the outstanding portion of the consolidation loan that repaid an eligible Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan.
