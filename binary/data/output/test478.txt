I want to open up a driving school and I have a few questions about applying.
I can help you with that, Have you received approval of your business name from DMV.
No, I haven't yet.
==========
Do you have employees that will be working at your business.
No, it will just be me for now.
Have you completed Personal History form MV-521,1 for each owner, partner, corporate officer, agent, employee, and major stockholder 20 % or more of stock listed on your Driving School Application MV-521.
==========
Yes, I have completed this.
Do I need to fill out any forms to show that I don't have employees.
Yes, you will need to submit a CE-200, which is available from the NY State Worker's Compensation Board, This form is very important because it shows the government agency that Workers Compensation and Disability Benefits insurance are not required.
==========
So, I don't have to get Disability Benefits insurance.
That is correct, Since you will not have any employees, Disability Benefits insurance is not required.
What happens after I apply.
After your application is reviewed by the Albany DMV, it will be sent to your local DMV office, Your local DMV office will then schedule an inspection of your business.
