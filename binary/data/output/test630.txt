Is there a requirement for me to list any schools on my FAFSA form.
You need to list at least one school, and any school that you list will use your FAFSA information to calculate the type and amount of aid that you may receive.
Is there a specific order required for this list of schools.
Before I answer that, will you be seeking federal student aid.
==========
No, I don't think I will.
Are you hoping to be considered for state aid.
No, I'm not planning on state aid either.
==========
How soon after I submit my FAFSA form will my list of schools have my information.
Within a few days of submitting the form, your schools will have your information, They may not necessarily contact you directly with an offer of aid right away, there is more information available on the website.
Is it possible for me to change my list of schools at a later date on my FAFSA form.
