Hi there, I'm getting everything set for my retirement, but I need some information.
Sure, You can always apply for the social security retirement.
==========
Great, How does it works.
You will be able to receive benefits that would be paid to you and it won't decrease the benefits for your spouse.
If my spouse and I apply both at the same time, we can also apply for the benefits as spouse.
==========
Yes, we can be able to check your eligibility on both.
That's pretty great, But how much cold be expect to receive.
==========
The total amount will depend on your spouse's benefit amount and the number of family members who apply for the benefit too.
Any kind of family relatives can apply for this.
==========
Yes, but this is under certain request, Have you seen the information on the section "benefits for your family".
Yes, I saw the information, but I didn't know it was related to tis.
You should also know that even if you do not qualify for benefits on someone else records some members of your family may qualify for benefits on your records.
==========
But there won't be any problem if my spouse is also receiving the benefits, right.
No, there is no problem, you and your spouse can even apply at the same time, without problems.
