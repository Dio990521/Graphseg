Greetings, now is it going there,, Hope great, really, Can you give me some light about a driving school setting.
Sure, If you're interested into opening a driving school, you must know that is necessary to get a DMV's approval for the use of its name in your school.
Oh right, that makes sense, You know, i'm meaning to teach pre-licensing, Are there any measures i should take.
Good, If you're planning to do that, then you must have adequate facilities and an experienced instructor that holds a valid instructor's card, with at least 1,000 hours of experience, In any case, you must request a premises check.
==========
O, k, so, i submit this and then, what.
Your request is sent to your local DMV office and you'll be scheduled for an inspection.
And then, can i apply, How.
Do you mean after you receive approval for your business name.
Yeah, that exactly, What happens there.
If you get the approval, you must then submit a Form MV-299,3 or Request for Approval of Driving School where you got your name's approval, along with a completed Form MV-521 or Driving School License Application.

I see, it seems pretty easy, What about if i have some other questions.
