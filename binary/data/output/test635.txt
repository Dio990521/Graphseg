Hi, I have a Federal Family Education Loan and have heard that I might be eligible for a discharge of my loan, Is this right.
Yes this is correct you might be eligible if your college made a falsely certified your eligibility to receive a loan.
If my college made this false certification how do I apply for a loan discharge.
There is a loan discharge application that you will have to complete.
As a parent of a student I received a Direct PLUS Loan, can this loan be discharged due to false certification.
Do you know if the school that your child attended falsely certified that your child would benefit from its training.
No this is not so.
==========
Did your child have a disqualifying status at the time the school certified your eligibility to receive the parent PLUS loan.
Yes she had a disqualifying status.
Okay.
==========
I believe that someone forged my signature on a loan document and I wish to apply for a loan discharge, How do I go about applying for a discharge.
In this case you should contact your loan servicer and they will be able to help you.
