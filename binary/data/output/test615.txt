==========
ok I have a problem If I am an FFEL borrower, but to qualify for this plan, must I not have had an outstanding balance on a FFEL Program loan.
Correct FFEL Program dates must be October 7, 1998, or the date you obtained a FFEL Program loan after October 7, 1998 and you must have more than $ 30,000 in outstanding FFEL Program loans.
I understand, but if I need to make lower monthly payments for a longer period of time than in plans like the Standard Payment Plan.
then the Extended Payment Plan may be right for you.
