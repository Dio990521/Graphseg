Hi, can you tell me how you can determine the amount of federal aid.
Various data are used to determine the amount of aid.
==========
Can you tell me what the COA is, please.
Sure, it's the amount it will cost you to go to school.
It is also worth noting that you must attend at least half time.
Can you explain that procedure to me more.
It is noteworthy that COA is always an estimate.
==========
What is non-need based aid.
The person in charge of estimating how much you can receive is your school.
For example, suppose COA is $ 16,000 and you have been awarded a total of $ 4,000 in need-based aid and private scholarships.
==========
Excellent.
The total amount can reach about 12 thousand dollars.
