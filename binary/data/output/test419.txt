Then you should send us a certified check, personal check or money order payable to Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.
What penalty do I have to pay if the order was issued on April 1, 1993.
In that case the civil penalty is $ 200.
I see, And in which cases do I need to pay the penalty.
If you refused to take a chemical test for alcohol or drugs, if you operated or permitted the operation of a motor vehicle without automobile liability insurance or if you operated a motor vehicle involved in a traffic crash and the vehicle was not covered by automobile liability insurance and your driver license or driving privilege was revoked you need to pay the penalty.
