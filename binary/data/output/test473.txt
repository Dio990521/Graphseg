I need sales tax and registration help.
Are you going to register a vehicle in New York at the DMV office.
==========
yes.
For the sales taxes you will have to pay the sales tax or prove that the sales tax was already paid.
do you have info on sales taxes, I had a lot of other things I wanted to look into.
==========
Would you like me to give you the link to a site where you can find more information.
no I'll just ask a few more questions.
Can I get a break if I'm in the service and not living in New York now.
==========
Yes, if you are a member of the U,S, Armed Forces and you do not reside in New York, you can defer your sales tax payment.
I don't reside in New York but I am a New Yorker, is that still for me.
The Sales Tax Exemption form provides information and the definitions to defer your sales tax, You must pay the sales tax when you leave the Armed Forces or you return to New York.
