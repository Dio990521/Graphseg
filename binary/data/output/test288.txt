Well hello, My name is Bill Smith and I was wondering if I qualify for veterans pension.
Of course, The Veterans Pension program provides monthly payments to wartime Veterans who meet certain age or disability requirements, and who have income and net worth within certain limits.
So,, do I qualify for it then.
You might qualify for the benefits, if you meet the VA pension eligibility requirements.
Do I need to meet several requirements.
Correct, If you do, you may be eligible for the Veterans Pension program.
What if I started on active duty before September 8, 1980.
==========
In that case you would fulfill one of the requirements.
And what about the other requirements.
==========
Did you NOT receive a dishonorable discharge.
No, I actually received a dishonorable discharge, That wasn't my fault though, Jim screwed up and our whole group was disciplined for it, we did nothing wrong.
==========
Then I'm afraid you're not eligible for the Veterans Pension program.
Fine then, Can you at least tell me how I figure out if I served under a eligible wartime period.
Gladly, Under current law, we recognize the following wartime periods to decide eligibility for VA pension benefits: Mexican Border period May 9, 1916, to April 5, 1917, for Veterans who served in Mexico, on its borders, or in adjacent waters.
