Hello, I urgently need to know more about driver civil penalties, There is one I need to pay asap.
Do you want to pay a driver civil penalty by mail for uninsured operation or uninsured accident.
==========
No, not by mail, It needs to be faster than that.
What do I need to make a fast online payment.
==========
You must provide the last four digits of your Social Security Number, your DMV ID Number Client ID Number from your NY State driver license, learner permit or non-driver photo ID card see where to find information on your driver license.
That's a start, Can I pay it at a DMV office too.
==========
Yes, you can pay the driver civil penalty at the office listed on your suspension or revocation order, but it s much faster and easier to pay online.
OK, And do I really have to pay it.
Yes, in many cases, For example, if your driver license was revoked because you refused to take a chemical test for alcohol or drugs, or you operated or permitted the operation of a motor vehicle without automobile liability insurance, or you operated a motor vehicle involved in a traffic crash and the vehicle was not covered by automobile liability insurance.
