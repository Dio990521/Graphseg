Hi, i'm helping a friend of mine looking for certain information about Rehab and employment, could you help me on that, She's on active duty.
No problem, Your friend may be eligible for those benefits and services if she's a service member and meet at least one of the proper requirements.
Great, That would be good news for her, Say, can a veteran person get its eligibility period extended.
Sure, that can happen, That depend on a VR Counselor, If it finds the the person has a serious employment handicap, then its eligibility period could be extended.
Umm, right, right,,In any case, what 's the original eligibility period.
That would be up to 12 years after the individual receive notice of its date of separation from active military service or its first VA service-connected disability rating.
Umm, o,k, at least is a reasonable period, Now, can you tell which are the requirements for VR&E if someone still on active duty.
That person is already having 20% or higher pre-discharge disability rating, Will he or she leaving soon the military.
That's correct in both questions, yes.
Well, then you may be eligible for those benefits.
==========
That's good to know, Say, i know this is kinda extreme but, lets say i lost my housing for something like a storm, i can still enjoy VR&E.
Yes, you can, You may qualify for 2 months of the employment adjustment allowance, You must contact your VRC for further details.
O,k , that really grat, So to get some VR&E, i need to meet the criteria right.
That's correct, And must be true.
