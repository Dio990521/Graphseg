No,I need more info but not that.
Do you know how often you need to get a background check.
Yes, i know that.
Do you want to keep your HazMat endorsement.
Yes, please.
In that case, the driver need to provide fingerprints and pass the background checks every five years.
Can I renew by phone.

Sorry but that's not possible.
Is it possible to get a temporary HazMat endorsement before background checks are completed.
Sorry but no, We can't issue the HazMat endorsement until the background checks are completed and approved, We will provide a CDL with the HazMat endorsement that is valid for 90 days.
