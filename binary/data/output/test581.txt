Hi I have a federal student loan and am wondering if I could repay it under an income-driven repayment plan.
You might be able to repayment it under an income-driven repayment plan but it depends on what type of loan you have.
Do you have a FFEL Program Loan or a Federal Perkins Loan.
I have a FFEL loan.
You might be able to get a Direct Consolidation Loan and then you could repay under the REPAYE plan.
==========
How do I go about applying for an Income-Driven Repayment Plan.
To apply for an Income-Driven Repayment Plan you will have to complete the paper application and provide a paper copy of your most recently filed federal income tax return or IRS tax return transcript.
What would my payment be under the REPAYE and ICR Plans.
Your payment is always based on your income and family size, regardless of any changes in your income.
