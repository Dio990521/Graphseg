I need some help with filling out an application for a disabled child.
Do you want to know how to apply for a child then.
Yes, exactly that.
==========
You will need to complete an Application for Supplemental Security Income SSI AND a Child Disability Report, The report collects information about the child 's disabling condition and how it affects his/her ability to function, At this time, only the Child Disability Report can be completed online.
Can you help me fill out my application.
Please contact us by phone or in person to schedule an appointment to complete the SSI application, We will help you in person or by phone.
Great, What else should I consider when applying.
==========
First of all, you should review the Child Disability Starter Kit, This kit answers common questions about applying for Supplemental Security Income SSI benefits for children , and includes a worksheet that will help you gather the information you need.
Did you contact Social Security to find out whether the income and resources of the parents and the child are within the allowed limits, and to start the SSI application process.

Was that the right thing to do.
