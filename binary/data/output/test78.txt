Hello there, Hope you're doing well, I came here to find out if I can keep doing the job I did before.
Of course, At this step, we decide if your medical impairment prevents you from performing any of your past work, If it doesn't, we'll decide you don't have a qualifying disability.
What if it does.
==========
Then we'll see if you can do any other type of work.
I'm a disabled widow, what conditions do I need to meet to receive benefits.
First of all your condition needs to meet the definition of disability for adults.
That's interesting, My daughter is also disabled and she recently reached 18 years of age, Can she apply for the same benefits then.
Is your child age 18 or older.
Yes, like I just wrote.
In that case we will evaluate his or her disability the same way we would evaluate the disability for any adult, We send the application to the Disability Determination Services in your state that completes the disability decision for us.
I see, So what benefits can you offer for me.
==========
Are you a worker that had an accident.
No, I've been a housewife all my life.
