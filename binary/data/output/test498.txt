I'm looking to get a replacement for a non-driver ID, but need more information, Could you help me on that, please.
Are you about to turn 21.
Yes, i will be 21 soon.

That's excellent, because then you can order your replacement ID within 40 days after your birthday, and you'll get it without waiting too much.
That's sounds really great, Think i'll do just that, Say, this replacement thing is only for when it is expired or what.
No, You can go through this in the sorry case your Id get lost or even stolen, or in a softer case, when you change your address, But what out, because you can't do this if your ID is already expired, In that case, you must apply for a new ID.
Well, i didn't aware of all that, Um, lets say i need to change something more than my address, what do i have to do, then.

For changes that goes beyond your address, you need to go to a DMV office, There you'll be able to perform those changes.
O,k, i see, I thought i could dodge that, Anyway, when you send me my ID,you'll do that to my house, right.
If that's the address we have on our records, then yes, it will be sent there, Or you can get it delivered to an alternate address you provide.
O,k, thanks, Last question, please, I understand that you request from us to have a certain document type in order to board flights, But,what if i don't want to get that other type of document, Can i still replace the original.
Sure, You only have to do the following: Complete an Application for Permit, Driver License or Non-Driver ID Card Form MV-44, Then, you come to the office and bring the required documents.
