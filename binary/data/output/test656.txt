Hi there, I would like to have some information related to receive financial aid as student.
Sure, We can bring you the best help we can provide to you, Is very important that you know that are the college or career school and not the u,s, department of education who are in charge to distribute the federal student aid.
==========
Oh, I see, That's very important thing to know, But when I start receiving the aid.
The type of aid you accepted will affect when you will get your aid.
==========
I see,,, But then, how I gonna get the textbooks and all the material I need for the classes.
The school must provide you a way to get for you to obtain your books and supplies by the seventh day of the term, You were elected for disbursement.
==========
Yes, I think I have.
Great, That way they most provide you the supplies you need  days before the term begins, You are aware that this will give you a credit balance, right.
Yes, I know that the money will be the one left over they take the part for all the tuition, fees and other charges.
That's right, The same way they will provide you all the supplies you need in time, so you don't have to worry to start the course without the things you need.
==========
Ok, great, I need to ask them to do the payments of they do it by their own.
The school must do the payments directly to you at least you ask for a different method of payment.
