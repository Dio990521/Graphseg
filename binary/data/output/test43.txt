Hey there, I would like to know more about benefits for my family.
Of course, Did you start to receive Social Security retirement benefits yet.
==========
Yes, since this month.
Well, then some members of your family may also qualify to receive benefits on your record, Your spouse or child may receive a monthly payment of up to one - half of your full retirement benefit amount, These payments will not decrease your retirement benefit.
What if they begin to receive those benefits.
Between age 62 and their full retirement age, the amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to their full retirement age.
Ah, that's good, And can you tell me more about the benefits for my spouse.
Gladly, Even if they have never worked under Social Security, your spouse may be able to get benefits if they are at least 62 years of age and you are receiving or eligible for retirement or disability benefits, Your spouse can also qualify for Medicare at age 65.
Hm, I see, What if one of my children is also eligible for benefits.
==========
Unfortunately there is a limit to the amount we can pay your family, The total depends on your benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on your record.
And what does that mean, What kind of limit.
At their full retirement age, the spouse s benefit can not exceed one - half of your full retirement amount.
