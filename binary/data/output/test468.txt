Is your snowmobile registered in your home state.
No, currently not.
==========
Can you suggest a topic to me.
Registration.
That brings me to an issue with my registration, Can I use an abbreviation of my street name, The space on the form is too narrow.
Yes, you can abbreviate or omit the street type if the street name is a word which has an accepted abbreviation.
==========
Why can't I enter my complete address on the NY registration for my snowmobile from Alabama.
The snowmobile registration system only allows for 20 characters for the street address and 14 characters for the city.
But what if my street address or city name is too long to fit in the field.
Please follow our guidelines in the order presented until the information fits within the field, use numbers digits instead of words, for the house number, for example.
==========
And how old do I need to be to register a vehicle in NY.
You must be at least 16 years old to register a vehicle in New York except a boat or ATV, A NY State Driver License, Learner Permit, or non-driver ID card that is current or not expired for more than 2 years can serve as proof of both identity and age.
