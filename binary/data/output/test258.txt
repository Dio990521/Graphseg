Hello there, I have some questions regarding the payment process.
Of course, We issue payments after each month's classes, For example, you'll get the payment for November classes in December.
Would you like to know what we pay for the post-9/11 GI Bill.
No, I would like to know WHEN you are paying everything, I haven't received it yet and need to manage my life.
So when are you going to make the support payments.
We pay the tuition and fees directly to the school and money for books to you at the beginning of the term.
So, what if I take classes at more than one school, Is that possible.
You can take classes at more than one school under the GI Bill as long as the classes at both schools count toward your degree, and the school granting your degree considers the classes at the second school to be required in order to get your degree.
Ah, makes sense, Can you tell me if your page has information about using GI Bill benefits for college.
Yes, on our page you can find out if you can use GI Bill benefits for college as a Veteran, service member, or qualified dependent, You can learn about payment rates for undergraduate and graduate degree courses at institutions of higher learning like a 4-year university, community college, or graduate school.
==========
And one final question: how are my payments calculated.
We decide your payment amounts based on the number of classes you go to and the hours spent in those classes, For most undergraduate degrees a college considers 12 or more hours full time.
