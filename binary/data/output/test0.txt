I need help planning my Social Security benefits for my survivors.
Are you currently planning for your future.
Yes, I am.
==========
you should think about what your family would need if you die now, Social Security can help your family if you have earned enough credits through your work.
Could the benefits received by my family be affected if my widow receives a pension based on work.
If it not covered by Social Security, her benefits as a survivor may be affected.
and what about my ex-wife, Would the benefits she'd receive affect the amount my widow gets.
It won't, the benefits your ex-wife would receive won't affect the benefits the rest of your survivors would receive.
And for my parents, what benefits can they receive.
==========
They can get the survivor benefits if you provide at least half of your parents' support and they are not eligible for retirement benefits higher than the benefit they would get as survivors from your record.
About my ex-wife, would she stop receiving the survivor benefit if she remarries after my death.
She won't if she remarries after turning 60 (50 if disabled).
