I want to fill out the FAFSA form to find out what I can get for financial aid, but I haven't applied to any schools yet because I don't know where I want to go and what I can afford, Can I leave the school part on the form blank.
Hello, I can certainly answer your question for you, You will need to list at least one school to help FAFSA calculate the types and amounts of financial aid you might receive.
Well, I know I want to stay in the my home state of Florida for school, Would that help.
To be eligible for state grant aid in the state of Florida, you must list at least one in-state college on your application in order to be considered.
So I have to know what school I am going to before I fill out the FAFSA.
No, you have to list at least 1 but up to 10 colleges that you are interested in so they can help figure out what aid you might qualify for.
Ok, I can do that then I guess, Do I have to put my favorites at the top of the list.
For federal student aid, the order of the schools on your list does not matter, In some states, there is a specified order, but in Florida, the order does not matter.
What if I decide later on a different school than the ones I have listed.
If you change your mind later, you can contact your state's agency in order to notify them of the change.
So if I switch school choice, will the financial aid amounts transfer.
You would have to contact your state agency to ask them that to know for sure.
