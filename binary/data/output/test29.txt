Can you help me with the benefits planner for retirement.
Of course, Do you need help regarding benefits for your family.
==========
Yes, I do.
Would you like to learn more about what happens when you start receiving Social Security retirement benefits then.
Sure, tell me about it.
==========
Gladly, As you might know, some members of your family may also qualify to receive benefits on your record, Your spouse or child may receive a monthly payment of up to one - half of your full retirement benefit amount, These payments will not decrease your retirement benefit.
I see, What if one of my children also qualifies for benefits.
Well, there is a limit to the amount we can pay your family, The total depends on your benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on your record.
Alright, So how much will my spouse receive.
First we need to ensure if your spouse qualifies for benefits on their own record, Do you know that.
==========
No, I really don't know, Sorry.
Do you know if the benefit on your record is higher than your spouse.
No, I'm sorry, I have no insight on that.
