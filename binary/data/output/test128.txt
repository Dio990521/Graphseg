Hey there, I have some questions, maybe you can help me out.
Do you have questions or need help understanding how to change your address and telephone number online.
No, I was wondering about something else.
Do you need a phone number for people who are deaf or hard of hearing then.
Err,,,no, No, thank you.
==========
My actual question is if a social security account is free of charge.
Of course, Creating a my Social Security account is free of charge, takes less than 10 minutes, lets you change and update your information and gives you access to many other online services.
What if I receive supplemental security income, Can I still use this service then.
No, unfortunately this service is not currently available to people who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or do not have a U,S, mailing address.
Then I guess there's no chance for me using it, as I have no U,S, address either, Am I right.
Unfortunately, yes.
