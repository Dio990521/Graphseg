Hello there, My daughter is 17 years old and I came here to find out what she needs to consider, being an underage driver.
Are you under the age of 18 or are you the parent of a driver under the age of 18 .
Yes, my daughter is under the age of 18.
Then it is very important that you understand the Graduated Driver License (GDL) Law and the restrictions on drivers under age 18.
==========
She has a learner permit though, does this mean she can't drive on her own.
Yes, she may not drive unless accompanied by a supervising driver age 21 or older who has a valid license to operate the vehicle she is driving, For example, only a person with a motorcycle license may supervise a person learning to drive a motorcycle.
I see, And how long until my daughter can take her road test, She just got her learner permit.
She must wait at least 6 months from the date she received her learner permit to schedule her road test.
So,,, how long until my daughter can take her road test, She just got her learner permit.
Are you under the age of 18.
No, I wanted to ask for my daughter, though.
What if she operates a moped with any valid class of learner permit.
In that case the same passenger rules as for normal vehicles apply.
