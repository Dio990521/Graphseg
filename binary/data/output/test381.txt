Hi there.
How can I help you.
==========
You indicated you're looking to replace a license, Is this true.
Yeah, I just changed my name.
==========
Sounds like you will need to go to a branch with the relevant documents.
What documents do I need to bring.
And what if I want it sent to an alternate address.
You would need to bring all relevant documents to the branch itself, as well as proof of residency at this alternate address.
Right, but I am out of the country right now.
==========
Do you have a APO/FPO if you are military.
Yes, I do, but how can I give that information to a branch.
There is a fax number on our website you can contact for the head branch and they will be able to handle it for you.
