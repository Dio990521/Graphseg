I want to know how I can renew my drivers license through the mail.
Okay,  I need to inform you that if you renew by mail your new license will show : ' NOT FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES ' unless you already have an enhanced license.
Did you want to renew by mail.
yes.
your new license will show : ' NOT FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES ' if it is not a REAL ID.
==========
what payment do you accept.
We accept credit/debit cards and check or money orders made out to Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, To do it online you must use a debit or credit card.
how do I get a card without the 'not for federal purposes' label.
==========
You can renew at the DMV office.
I need to change my license type too and it is over 3 years expired, so what do I do.
==========
You need to apply for an original license and you must pass the vision test and the written test, you need to complete a pre-licensing course and pass a Road Test.
and can I change my address when I renew.
You need to change your address online then renew, There is no guarantee that the US Postal Service will forward your DMV documents to your new address.
