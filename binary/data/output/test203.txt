I have a health question about possible exposure to toxic environment while on duty.
Did this exposure occur while you were in the field while serving in Iraq , Afghanistan , and other areas.
==========
No it happened in the States.
I'd like to file for benefits related to this can you tell me what I need to do.
You will have to show that your health problems are causally linked to your contact with certain environmental hazards while serving in the military.
==========
What if I was exposed to particulate matter and it has caused asthma.
You would qualify if you were in contact with particulate matter or large burn pits in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, for example.
==========
It might have also been toxic soil, can I qualify for that as well.
Yes if you have illnesses or other conditions that were caused by these environmentally toxic chemicals in the air, water, or soil.
