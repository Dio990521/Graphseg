Tell me about the FAFSA application renewal.
The first thing you need to know is that you have to renew your FAFSA application every year.
Can you guide me through it.
Sure, Have you already logged in to renew your application.
Not yet.
==========
Can I do it through the myStudentAid app.
Yes, you can, Once you log in as a student on the app the FAFSA renewal form should display automatically if you are eligible for renewal.
==========
I just did it and it looks like the form is already filled.
What you see in the form is the prefilled information from your previous academic year, You need to update any needed information and add your new income and tax information.
==========
Great, And, I'm just curious but what does FAFSA mean.
It means Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
