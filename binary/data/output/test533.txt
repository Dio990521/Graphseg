Could you give me some information about if there is any program that would allow me to temporarily stop making payments on my student loan.
Deferment might be a good option for you as long as you realize that if you won't have to make a payment, you probably won't be making any progress toward forgiveness or paying back your loan.

Could you please explain to me what that means.
Income-driven repayment plans base your monthly payments on your income and family size, meaning that in some cases, you payment under this plan could become as low as $0 per month.

Can you tell me about an in-school deferment if I am enrolled in college more than half-time.
With that option, in most cases your loan will be placed into a deferment automatically based on enrollment information reported by your school, and your loan servicer will notify you that the deferment has been granted.
==========
Are there any extra considerations if I am actually attending school and am active duty military at this time.
You may be eligible for this deferment if you are on active duty military service in connection with a war, military operation, or national emergency.
If a global pandemic is considered a national emergency, then that does describe my situation.
==========
You may be eligible for this deferment.
What is a Graduate Fellowship Deferment.
You could complete the Graduate Fellowship Deferment Request if you are enrolled in an approved graduate fellowship program, which is generally a program that provides financial support to graduate students to pursue graduate studies and research.
