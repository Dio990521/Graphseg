Hi, I need help with planning for retirement.
Are you looking for information for you or for your family.
I am just looking for help for me.
Are you looking for information on maximum family benefits.
Sure, that may help.
Do you have children.
No, I do not.
==========
Do you have information for benefits for my spouse.
Yes, I can help with information if you want benefits between the age of 62 and full retirement age.
What if my spouse already has benefits.
They will get more money based on their own record and your record.
